NetBackup status codes

This chapter includes the following topics:

■ NetBackup status codes

■ NetBackup KMS status codes

NetBackup status codes

The following is a complete list of the NetBackup status codes that are listed in
numerical order:

Note: The term media server, as distinct from master server or server, does not
apply to the NetBackup server product. When you troubleshoot a Server installation,
ignore any references to media server. (This note does not apply to the NetBackup
Enterprise Server.)

NetBackup status code: 0

Message: the requested operation was successfully completed
Explanation: No problems were detected with the requested operation.
Recommended Action: No action is needed, unless a database was backed up
through a database extension product (for example, NetBackup for Oracle or
NetBackup for SQL Server). In those instances, code 0 means the backup script
(that started the backup) ran without error. However, you must check other status
as explained in the related NetBackup manual to see if the database was
successfully backed up.

Base about this status code.

NetBackup status code: 1

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

45

Message: The requested operation was partially successful
Explanation: A problem was detected that may require corrective action during
the requested operation.
Recommended Action: Check the All Log Entries report and also the progress
log (if there is one).
The following are some of the problems that can appear under status code 1:
■ A file or a directory path is more than 1023 characters long.

For NetBackup Snapshot Client, the maximum path name length is 1000
characters for snapshot backups, not 1023. When the snapshot is created, a
new mount point is added to the beginning of the file path. If the new mount
point plus the original file path exceeds 1023 characters, the backup fails with
status code 1. The progress log includes the entry
ERR-Skipping long dir path.

■ You cannot open a file.

The file may have been locked for some reason.

■ The following information applies only to UNIX systems:

NetBackup cannot get the link name of a file.

■ The following information applies only to UNIX systems:

NetBackup cannot process a sparse file.

■ A read error that was encountered in a file.
■ File is of an unknown type, or may be hidden.
■ The following information applies only to UNIX systems:

The lstat system call fails on a file that is eligible to be backed up. This error
may be a permission problem.

■ The following information applies only to UNIX systems:

A file cannot be locked that has mandatory locking enabled.

■ A synthetic backup job may terminate with a status code 1 under the following

conditions:
■ No images were found to synthesize (status code = 607).
■ TIR information has been pruned from component images (status code =

136).
Image format is unsupported (status code = 79).

■

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

46

The synthetic backup job logs the actual status code in the NetBackup error
log. Refer to the documentation for the corresponding NetBackup error code
for the corrective action to take.

■ A BMR job may terminate with status code 1 in the following situation:

You save the BMR configuration and it returns an error even though the child
jobs completed successfully. For information, examine the Detailed Status tab
of the Job Details dialog box, or the nbjm unified log (originator ID 117).

■ A policy that contains multiple backup scripts starts a scheduled backup of a

UNIX database extension client. If it fails with a status code 1, some of the
backup scripts returned a failure status.

■ On clients using Windows Open File Backups (WOFB) to back up open or active

files, the following may occur:
Volume snapshots were not enabled successfully for the backup.
The following logging messages should appear in the bpbkar32 logs if volume
snapshots were not successfully enabled.
If multistreamed backup jobs are enabled, log messages similar to the following
appear that indicate volume snapshots were not enabled for the multistreamed
backup job:
11:05:44.601 AM: [1536.724] <4> tar_backup::V_AddToFI_XBSAObj:
INF - Volume snapshots not enabled for: D:\Directory1

If multistreamed backups were not enabled, log messages similar to the following
appear, which indicate volume snapshots were not enabled for the non-streamed
backup job:
1:59:41.229 PM: [2076.2088] <4>
V_Snapshot::V_Snapshot_CreateSnapshot: INF -
===============================
1:59:41.229 PM: [2076.2088] <4>

1:59:41.799 PM: [2076.2088] <4>
V_Snapshot::V_Snapshot_CreateSnapshot: INF - Snapshot creation
was not successful
1:59:41.799 PM: [2076.2088] <4>
V_Snapshot::V_Snapshot_CreateSnapshot: INF -
===============================

In this case, examine the bpfis logs for error messages regarding snapshot
creation failures. More details are available on the bpfis logs.
See the NetBackup Snapshot Client Administrator’s Guide.
In the bpfis logs, the following messages may appear when snapshot creation
fails for Windows Open File Backup:
First message:
04:01:14.168 [376.2364] <32> onlfi_fi_split: VfMS error 11; see
following messages:
04:01:14.168 [376.2364] <32> onlfi_fi_split: Fatal method error
was reported
04:01:14.168 [376.2364] <32> onlfi_fi_split: vfm_freeze_commit:
method: VSP, type: FIM, function: VSP_make
04:01:14.168 [376.2364] <32> onlfi_fi_split: VfMS method error
3; see following message:
04:01:14.168 [376.2364] <32> onlfi_fi_split: snapshot services:
snapshot creation failed: invalid argument(s).

Cause: VSP was not enabled because the VSP snapshot for the backup did
not meet the specified minimum time in the Busy File Wait VSP setting.
Either increase the Busy File Timeout VSP setting (recommended setting: 300
seconds or more) or submit the backup job when the volume has less activity.
Second message:
04:17:55.571 [1636.3224] <2> onlfi_vfms_logf: snapshot services:
(null): There was an unexpected error while preparing the VSP
snapshot transaction. Dumping the parameter array to provide
more information: Error 112 from VSP_Prepare

Cause: VSP was not enabled for the backup because the client for the VSP
Snapshot Cache files does not have enough free disk space.
Free up disk space on the volumes being backed up.
Third message:
If Microsoft Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) is used as the Windows Open
File Backup snapshot provider and snapshot creation fails, refer to the following:
Event Viewer’s Application and System Logs for error information.

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

48

■ A snapshot error may have occurred. Also, you may have some clients that use

the Windows Open File Backup option to back up open or active files. In this
case, a log message in the bpbkar32 debug log appears, which indicates that
a snapshot error occurred.
The following is an example of a snapshot error:
8:51:14.569 AM: [1924.2304] <2> tar_base::V_vTarMsgW: ERR -
Snapshot Error while reading test.file

See the recommended actions under status code 156.

■ The backup of Microsoft Exchange Server included multiple databases, but not

all of the databases were backed up successfully. Check the job details for
statements about the databases that were not backed up. In a full or a differential
backup, the transaction logs are truncated for any databases that are backed
up successfully. The transaction logs can be restored from the backup image
even if backups of other databases fail. Warning: Any database for which the
backup has failed is unprotected by this backup.

■ A granular-enabled backup of Microsoft Exchange Server successfully backed
up the databases, but the second GRT phase to capture mailbox-level information
failed. Check the job details for the cause of the failure. In a full or differential
backup, the transaction logs are truncated for any databases that are backed
up successfully, regardless of whether the GRT phase succeeds. Any database
that is backed up successfully can be restored from the backup image even if
the GRT phase fails.

■ During VMware backup, the virtual machine cannot be unlocked to allow storage

migration.
The virtual machine can be restored from this backup. However, you may want
to correct this problem before the next backup.

■ During VMware backup, the virtual machine snapshot cannot be deleted or the

virtual machine's disks cannot be consolidated.
The virtual machine can be restored from this backup. However, you may want
to correct this problem before the next backup.

■ During VMware restore, the virtual machine cannot be imported into vCloud. In
the Activity Monitor, the Detailed Status tab of the job details includes messages
from vCloud Director that indicate the reason for the error.
The restored virtual machine is present on the destination vCenter. However,
you must manually import it into vCloud.

A NetApp NDMP accelerator backup may terminate with a status code 1 with the
following clock discrepancy warnings for the volumes:

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

49

■ Clock discrepancy detected between NDMP filer and NetBackup

Media Server.

■ If this is not expected, please perform a backup with Accelerator

forced rescan enabled.

■ In order to stop seeing these messages, please address

clock discrepancy.

This problem can be caused by one of the following situations:

■

■

If the NetApp filer and NetBackup NDMP backup host have a time difference
of more than 1 hour, a clock discrepancy warning is displayed for all of the
volumes.
Check the time difference for the affected volumes and update as required, or
use a media server that is in the same time zone as the filer.

Note: An NTP server is the recommended method to ensure the correct time.

If any SnapMirror (Data Protection) volume has a lag time of more than 1 hour,
the warnings appear for that volume.
Use the following command to determine if the volume is a Data Protection
volume and if the lag time is greater than 1 hour:
■ For NetApp Clustered Data ONTAP (cDOT):

snapmirror show -fields lag-time

■ For NetApp 7-mode:
snapmirror status

If Data Protection volumes are found on the filer, either:
■ Browse to and select the volumes for backup in the Backup Selections for

the NetBackup policy.

■ Use the VOLUME_EXCLUDE_LIST with the ALL_FILESYSTEMS directive

to exclude the mirror volumes.

Base about this status code.

NetBackup status code: 2

Message: none of the requested files were backed up
Explanation: A backup or archive did not back up any of the files in the file list.

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

50

This status code applies primarily to automatic backups using Lotus Notes or SQL
Server database agents, when all the backups that are job-related have failed. Or,
an Enterprise Vault backup has failed. It should not occur for standard file system
backups.
Open a NetBackup support case (as recommended in technical note TECH38838)
if you encounter this error for a UNIX, Linux, or Windows file system backup, or for
database agents other than SQL Server or Lotus Notes.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ The following information applies only to Lotus Notes:

This error occurs when archive style logging is not enabled for the Lotus Domino
server on UNIX. It also occurs when another backup of the transaction logs is
in progress.

■ For troubleshooting guidance, such as a list of logs to gather, and for details on

particular issues, refer to technical note TECH38838.

■ See the troubleshooting topic of the appropriate guide for a description of

troubleshooting tools:
■ NetBackup for Microsoft SQL Server Administrator’s Guide
■ NetBackup for Lotus Notes Administrator’s Guide
■ NetBackup for Enterprise Vault Agent Administrator’s Guide

Base about this status code.

NetBackup status code: 3

Message: valid archive image produced, but no files deleted due to non-fatal
problems
Explanation: The backup portion of the archive command reported problems so
the files were not deleted.
Recommended Action: Examine the progress log or status of the archive on the
client to determine if you need to retry the archive after you correct the problem. If
the problem is not serious and the files were backed up, you can manually delete
the files. To verify the files that were backed up, use the NetBackup client-user
interface in restore mode and browse the files in the archive.
A possible cause for files not being deleted is that you do not have the necessary
permissions. NetBackup cannot delete files unless you are the user that owns the
files, a superuser on UNIX, or an administrator on Windows.

Base about this status code.

NetBackup status code: 4

Message: archive file removal failed
Explanation: The backup portion of the completed archive was successful but the
delete failed.
Recommended Action: Verify that you have permission to delete the files and
that the read-only flag is not set for the files. On UNIX clients, verify that you have
write permission to the directories that contain the files. Since the backup was
successful, you can delete the files that were backed up. (If you do not have the
necessary permissions, have the system administrator delete the files.)

Base about this status code.

NetBackup status code: 5

Message: the restore failed to recover the requested files
Explanation: Errors caused the restore to fail.
For a virtual machine restore that uses Instant Recovery, this error can occur for
the following reasons:
■ A name was specified incorrectly for the resource pool or temporary datastore.
■ The virtual machine cannot be mounted or activated in vSphere.
Recommended Action: Perform the following items in the order presented:
■ Ensure that the client’s server list contains entries for the master server and any

media servers that can be used during a backup or restore.

■ Examine the status or the progress log on the client for messages on why the

restore failed. Also, check the All Log Entries report on the server.

■ Check ownership and permission on directories where files are restored.
■ Correct the problems that you find and retry the restore.
For a virtual machine restore that uses Instant Recovery, ensure that the names
for the required parameters are specified correctly. Also, check for known issues
in the vSphere tasks or events. For detailed debugging, consult the bpVMutil logs
on the restore host:
install_path\NetBackup\logs\bpVMutil

Base about this status code.

NetBackup status code: 6

Message: the backup failed to back up the requested files
Explanation: Errors caused the user backup to fail.
For VMware backups, this error can occur for the following reasons:
■ VMware item 1: The virtual machine and the backup host virtual machine (for
hotadd backup) may contain too many disks. If the total is too great for the SCSI
controllers on the backup host, a backup with the hotadd transport mode fails.
The following appears in the job status log:
ERR - Error opening the snapshot disks using given transport mode:
Status 23

■ VMware item 2: If the VMware backup host cannot access the datastore over
the selected transport mode, the backup fails. The detailed status log on the
backup host may contain the following:
12/4/2009 1:12:34 PM - Error bpbrm(pid=21376) from client vm4: ERR
- Error opening the snapshot disks using given transport mode:
Status 23

■ VMware item 3: Storage vMotion migrated the virtual machine’s files when

NetBackup performed a backup of the virtual machine directly through the ESX
server.

■ VMware item 4: For hotadd backups: The backup host was unable to resolve
the host name of the ESX server. This error may occur if DNS is not correctly
configured on the virtual machine where the backup host is installed.

■ VMware item 5: For hotadd backups: If the VM to back up and the VM that
contains the backup host do not reside in the same data center, the backup
fails.

■ VMware item 6: A previous hotadd backup of the virtual machine may have

failed, as follows:

■

■

In hotadd backup, VMware creates a linked clone of the VM's disks and
attaches the cloned disks to the backup host. (The attached disks can be
seen in the vSphere Client.) If a hotadd backup of the VM fails, NetBackup
may be unable to remove the cloned disks from the backup host. In the
backup host, the cloned disks prevent subsequent backups from completing.
In a VM backup, VMware creates mount directories in the C:\Windows\Temp
folder on the backup host. After the backup, VMware automatically removes

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

53

the mount directories. In some cases, such as when the backup uses the
hotadd transport mode, NetBackup may be unable to remove the mount
directories.

■ VMware item 7: Although vSphere 6.0 supports Internet Protocol version 6

(IPv6), it does not support dual-stack configurations with both IPv4 and IPv6.
(In a dual-stack network, network nodes are enabled for both IPv4 and IPv6.)
Note the following:

■

■

If both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are enabled, vCenter 6.0 uses IPv4
addresses only.
If a vCenter server DNS name resolves to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
and the IPv6 address is unreachable, note that the VMware VDDK APIs
attempt to communicate over IPv6 and fail. As a result, a NetBackup backup
job also fails, with status code 6.

Recommended Action: Do the following as appropriate:
■ Verify that you have read access to the files. Check the status or the progress
log on the client for messages about why the backup failed. Correct problems
and retry the backup.

■ The following information applies only to Windows clients:

Verify that the account used to start the NetBackup Client service has read
access to the files.

■ For a UNIX or Linux database extension client (for example, NetBackup for

Oracle), this status code can indicate a problem with the script that controls the
backup.
Check the progress report on the client for a message such as the following:
Script exited with status code = number

The number varies. The progress log usually names the script.
Check the script for problems. Also, check the troubleshooting logs created by
the database extension. See the NetBackup guide that came with the database
extension for information on the scripts and the troubleshooting logs.

■ VMware item 1: Add more SCSI controllers to the backup host virtual machine.
■ VMware item 2: Select a different transport mode and retry the backup.
■ VMware item 3: To avoid conflicts with Storage vMotion in vSphere 5.0 or later,

NetBackup should conduct backups through the vCenter server. For more
information, see the NetBackup for VMware Administrator's Guide.

■ VMware item 4: On the virtual machine, you can enter the IP address of the

ESX server into the hosts file: \Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

54

■ VMware item 5: For a successful hotadd backup, the two virtual machines must

be in the same VMware data center.

■ VMware item 6: Certain mount directories or cloned disks must be manually

removed to allow hotadd backups to succeed, as follows:
■ Remove the cloned disks from the VMware backup host and retry the backup.
■ Remove the mount directories from the \Temp folder and retry the backup.

The folder name contains a string such as VMware-System.

■ VMware item 7: Ensure that the vCenter’s DNS name resolves to either an IPv4

or IPv6 address (not both).

Base about this status code.

NetBackup status code: 7

Message: the archive failed to back up the requested files
Explanation: Errors caused the user archive to fail.
Recommended Action: Verify that you have read access to the files. Check the
progress log or the status on the client for messages on why the archive failed.
Correct problems and retry the archive.
On Windows clients, verify that the account used to start the NetBackup services
has read access to the files.

Base about this status code.

NetBackup status code: 8

Message: unable to determine the status of rbak
Explanation: On DomainOS clients, rbak is used to do restores. If rbak does not
exit with a status message, NetBackup cannot determine if the restore works.
Recommended Action: Check for a new core file to see if rbak quit abnormally.
Check the ps output to see if rbak is hung. If so, cancel it and try again. Check the
progress log for any unusual messages from rbak.

Base about this status code.

NetBackup status code: 9

Message: a necessary extension package is not installed or not configured properly

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

55

Explanation: A NetBackup extension product must be installed and configured to
perform the requested operation.
Recommended Action: Verify that the required extension product is installed and
configured.
Click here to view technical notes and other information in the Veritas Knowledge
Base about this status code.

NetBackup status code: 10

Message: allocation failed
Explanation: The system memory allocation fails because of insufficient system
memory available. A possible cause is that the system is overloaded with too many
processes and not enough physical or virtual memory.
Recommended Action: Free up memory by terminating any unneeded processes
that consume memory. Add more swap space or physical memory.
Click here to view technical notes and other information in the Veritas Knowledge
Base about this status code.

NetBackup status code: 11

Message: system call failed
Explanation: A system call has failed. This status code is used for a generic system
call failure that does not have its own status code.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ Check the All Log Entries and Problems reports to determine the system call

that failed and other information about the error.

■ nbjm and nbproxy return status code 11 when an exception is processed, such
as when nbproxy obtains policy or configuration information. Examine the nbjm
unified log (originator ID 117) or the nbproxy legacy log for more detail on the
cause of the error.

■ A frequent cause is that the server’s file system is full. For example, you may
see a message similar to the following in the Problems report or bpdbm debug
log:
06/27/95 01:04:00 romb romb db_FLISTsend failed: system call
failed (11)
06/27/95 01:04:01 romb romb media manager terminated by parent
process

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

06/27/95 01:05:15 romb romb backup of client romb that exited with
status 11 (system call failed)

On UNIX systems, run a df command on the /usr/openv/netbackup/db
directory.
If the df command does not reveal the problem, check the bpdbm debug logs
or do a grep for the message
system call failed

In relevant files under the directory /usr/openv/netbackup/db/error/
On Windows systems, verify that the disk partition where NetBackup is installed
has enough room.

■ Verify that the system is not running out of virtual memory. If virtual memory is

the problem, turn off unused applications or increase the amount of virtual
memory.
To increase virtual memory on Windows, do the following in the order presented:
■ Display the Control Panel.
■ Double-click System.
■ On the Performance tab, set Virtual Memory to a higher value.

■ The following information applies only to UNIX clients:

Check for a semaphore problem. This error may occur because the system
does not have enough allocated semaphores. It is most commonly seen on
Solaris servers when an RDBMS is also running.
The symptoms of the problem vary. In some cases, error messages in the
NetBackup log indicate a backup failure due to an error in semaphore operation.
Another symptom is the inability of the NetBackup device manager daemon,
ltid, to acquire a needed semaphore.
System requirements vary; thus, no definite recommendations can be made.
One customer running NetBackup and ORACLE on a Solaris server made the
following changes to the /etc/system file and then restarted the system (boot
-r). The changes were adequate.
set semsys:seminfo_semmni=300
set semsys:seminfo_semmns=300
set semsys:seminfo_semmsl=300
set semsys:seminfo_semmnu=600

Set these attributes to a value great enough to provide resources to all
applications on your system.

Base about this status code.

NetBackup status code: 12

Message: file open failed
Explanation: An open of a file failed.
A disk storage unit tries to write to or create a directory on the root device of the
NetBackup server or media server. In this case, the Activity Monitor job details log
contains the message "not permitted to root device." By default, the absolute path
or specified directory for a disk storage unit cannot be on the root file system (or
system disk). You must explicitly enable them to be there when the storage unit is
created.
Recommended Action: Do the following as appropriate:

■

■

■

If you want the path for the disk storage unit to reside in the root file system:
Open the Change Storage Unit dialog box in the NetBackup Administration
Console and select the check box: This directory can exist on the root file
system or system disk.
If the specified path for the disk storage unit is not in the root file system or
system device, verify that the path is in a mounted file system.
If the specified path for the disk storage unit is in the root file system or system
device but does not need to be there, use the Change Storage Unit dialog box
to specify a different (non-root) path in a mounted file system.

■ Check the NetBackup Problems report. Try to determine the file and why the

error occurred. A possible cause is a permission problem with the file. For
detailed troubleshooting information, create a debug log directory for the process
that returned this status code. Then, retry the operation and check the resulting
debug log.

■ For NetBackup Lotus Notes, point-in-time restore jobs may fail with a status 12.
These jobs are initiated from the master server by using either the NetBackup
Administration Console or the Backup, Archive, and Restore interface. Their
failure is reported in the NetBackup tar log file. (For Windows, this file is located
in the install_path\NetBackup\logs\tar folder. For UNIX, it is located in the
/usr/openv/netbackup/logs/tar folder.) If the install path of the NetBackup
master server is different from the install path of the NetBackup client, the
automatic restore of Lotus transaction log extents during recovery of the Lotus
database fail. Note that the Activity Monitor shows a status 0 (successful). The

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

58

tar log on the client, however, shows success for the restore but a failure (status
12) for the Lotus database recovery.
Perform the restore job from the Backup, Archive, and Restore interface on the
NetBackup client.

■ For NetBackup Snapshot Client, status code 12 may appear in the
/usr/openv/netbackup/logs/bptm or bpdm log with the following:
tpc_read_config failed: cannot open file
/usr/openv/volmgr/database/3pc.conf

This status code may indicate that the policy is configured with either the
NetBackup media server or the Third-party Copy Device as the off-host backup
method, but the 3pc.conf file does not exist or is in the wrong location.
Instructions are available on how to create the 3pc.conf file.
See the NetBackup Snapshot Client Administrator’s Guide.

■ For a FlashBackup policy, if the CACHE= entry follows the source data entry,
the backup fails with status code 12. Messages such as the following appear in
the /usr/openv/netbackup/logs/bpbkar logs on the client:
09:55:33.941 [6092] <16> bpfsmap: ERR - open_snapdisk: NetBackup
snapshot enable failed error 3
09:55:33.942 [6092] <32> bpfsmap: FTL - bpfsmap: can't open

09:55:33.957 [6092] <2> bpbkar Exit: INF - Close of stdout
complete

Change the order of the backup selections list so that the CACHE entry precedes
the source data entry. (The source data entry specifies the raw partition that
contains the file system to be backed up.)

NetBackup status code: 13

Message: file read failed
Explanation: A read of a file or socket failed.
The possible causes include the following:

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

59

■ A network communication problem that occurred on the master server, media

server, or one of the clients.

■ An I/O error that occurred during a read from the file system.
■ Read of an incomplete file or a corrupt file.
■ A socket read failure caused by a network problem or a problem with the process

that writes to the socket.

■ A problem specific to NetBackup Snapshot Client (see recommended actions).
■ The first EV-SQL backup after a NetBackup installation failed.

See the Troubleshooting section of the NetBackup for Enterprise Vault Agent
Administrator’s Guide.

■ On Windows, the file list that NetBackup generates for the snapshot copy

operation does not have enough information to restore from the tar32 copy.
For example, block number information is not correct because the tar32 copy
is not yet created.

■ NetBackup does not support the policy’s Enable file recovery from VM backup

option for dual-boot VMs.

■ Locking timeouts in the VMware VDDK may cause simultaneous hotadd backups

from the same VMware backup host to fail.
In the NetBackup Activity Monitor, the detailed status log may include messages
similar to the following:
12/05/2014 06:43:53 - begin writing
12/05/2014 06:48:53 - Error bpbrm (pid=2605) socket read failed:
errno = 62 - Timer expired
12/05/2014 06:48:55 - Error bptm (pid=2654) media manager terminated
by parent process

The /NetBackup/logs/vxms log may include repeated instances of a VDDK
message similar to the following:
12/08/2014 05:11:35 : g_vixInterfaceLogger:libvix.cpp:1844 <DEBUG> :
[VFM_ESINFO] 2014-12-08T05:11:35.146-06:00 [7F1B1163F700 info Libs']
FILE: FileLockWaitForPossession timeout on '/var/log/vmware/hotAddLock.
dat.lck/M34709.lck' due to a local process '15882-26732358(bpbkarv)'

Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ Check the NetBackup Problems report for clues on where and why the problem

occurred.

■ Check that network communication works properly.

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

60

See "Resolving network communication problems" in the NetBackup
Troubleshooting Guide.

■ For a FlashBackup client, check the /var/adm/messages log for errors like the

following:
Mar 24 01:35:58 bison unix: WARNING: sn_alloccache: cache
/dev/rdsk/c0t2d0s3 full - all snaps using this cache are now
unusable

This error indicates that the cache partition is not large enough. If possible,
increase the size of the cache partition. Or, if multiple backups use the same
cache, reduce the number of concurrent backups. To reduce the number,
reschedule some of them or reschedule the entire backup to a time when the
file system is less active.

■ For detailed troubleshooting information, create a debug log directory for the

process that returned this status code. Then retry the operation and check the
resulting debug log.

■ Ensure that the latest service packs for all products and components (SQL

Server, Exchange, Notes, etc.) have been installed.

■ Ensure that all the network hardware (NICs, hubs, switches, routers, etc.)

throughout the environment are set to full duplex, not half duplex.

■ Check the following items regarding the NICs in your system:
■ Upgrade to the latest NIC drivers throughout the system.
■ Ensure that all NICs are set to full duplex, not half duplex.

■

See Troubleshooting network interface card performance in the NetBackup
Troubleshooting Guide.
Increase the timeout settings on the NIC.
If NIC teaming is implemented, deactivate for testing purposes.

■
■ Replace the NIC itself on the affected client or server.

■ For NetBackup Snapshot Client, status code 13 may appear in the

/usr/openv/netbackup/logs/bpbkar log.
The log can indicate the following:
■ The files to back up reside on an IDE drive as opposed to SCSI. The off-host

backup method was set to either NetBackup media server or Third-Party
Copy Device. If you use off-host backup, the disk that contains the client
files must be a SCSI or Fibre Channel device.
If the disk is an IDE drive, you may see the following in the /usr/openv/
netbackup/logs/bpfis log:

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

61

get_disk_info: FTL - /var/tmp/caa026fEU disk_inquiry failed.
Errno = 25: Inappropriate ioctl for device

The following listing may appear in the /usr/openv/netbackup/logs/bpbkar
log:
bpbkar: INF - Processing /var
bpbkar: ERR - get_disk_info() failed, status 13
bpbkar: ERR - tpc_get_disk_info() failed: err 13
bpbkar: ERR - bpbkar FATAL exit status = 13: file read failed
bpbkar: INF - EXIT STATUS 13: file read failed

■ The files to back up exist on a file system that is not mounted. The file system
that is specified as the snapshot source must be mounted. If the snapshot
source is not mounted but the mount point is present, NetBackup may try to
take a snapshot of the directory preceding the directory that was specified
as the snapshot source.

■ For the NetBackup media server method, you may need to increase the
client read timeout value. In some environments, NetBackup may require
more read time than the default value allows. If the client read timeout is
insufficient, the backup may fail and that causes this error.
To increase the client read timeout for all clients, in the NetBackup
Administration Console, go to Host Properties > Master Servers >
double-click the master server, then go to Properties > Timeouts. Then,
increase the client read timeout.

■ On Windows, refresh the Backup, Archive, and Restore client console and
retry the restore. This action refreshes the file list that is displayed in the client
console and passes the correct information about the selected files.

■ To prevent timeouts in the VMware VDDK that cause simultaneous hotadd

backups from the same VMware backup host to fail, do one of the following:
■ Reduce the number of hotadd backups that run simultaneously.

■

Increase the client-read timeout on the media server as appropriate (15
minutes or more):
In the NetBackup Administration Console, click NetBackup Management
> Host Properties > Double-click on media server > Timeouts > Client
read timeout.

Message: file write failed
Explanation: A write to a file or socket failed.
Possible causes include the following:
■ An I/O error that occurred during a write to the file system.
■ Write to a socket failed. The cause of this failure is a network problem or a

problem with the process that reads from the socket.

■ Writing to a full disk partition.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ Check the NetBackup Problems report for clues on where and why the problem

occurred.

■ For detailed troubleshooting information, create a debug log directory for the

process that returned this status code. Then retry the operation and check the
resulting debug log.

■ Make sure that the routers, bridges, and other network devices are all at "full"

duplex.
See Troubleshooting network interface card performance in the NetBackup
Troubleshooting Guide.

■ Use a "sniffer" program to determine the number of packets being rejected or

re-requested.

■ On Windows systems, the client bpbkar log may contain a 10054 Connection

Reset Error (usually indicates a hardware error). Somewhere between the
NetBackup client and server, the connection was reset. When NetBackup
receives this error, it cannot continue the backup. This error has been attributed
to the following:
■ A hiccup in the network.
■ A bad network interface card on a NetBackup client.
■ A bad network interface card on the NetBackup server.
■ Faulty routers.
■ Any other applications that interfere with NetBackup connections.

■ The error occurs while you use the NetBackup Java interface: The application
server (bpjava processes) for the NetBackup Java interface probably ran out
of disk space in the file system containing
/usr/openv/netbackup/logs/user_ops. The application server writes temporary

NetBackup status codes

files into directories in the /user_ops directory. Try clearing up disk space in
the file system.

NetBackup status code: 19

Message: getservbyname failed
Explanation: A call to getservbyname() failed. The getservbyname()function
uses the name of the service to find a service entry in the services file. (Or NIS
services map on UNIX if it is configured.)
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ Check the NetBackup Problems report for clues on why the failure occurred.
■ On a UNIX or Linux system, check that /etc/services and NIS services map
(if applicable) have entries for the NetBackup services: bpcd, bpdbm, and bprd.

■ On a Windows system, verify that the

%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\services file shows the correct entries
for the NetBackup Internet processes: bpcd, bpdbm, and bprd.
Ensure that the following numbers match the settings in the services file: The
NetBackup Client Service Port number and NetBackup Request Service Port
number on the Network tab in the NetBackup Client Properties dialog box.
To display this dialog box, start the Backup, Archive, and Restore interface and
click NetBackup Client Properties on the File menu. The values on the
Network tab are written to the services file when the NetBackup Client service
starts.
See "Verifying host name and service entries" in the NetBackup Troubleshooting
Guide.

NetBackup status code: 20

Message: invalid command parameter

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

65

Explanation: One or more command parameters were not valid. This error can
occur when incompatible levels of NetBackup are installed on a master and its
media servers or clients. For example, a NetBackup master server has NetBackup
8.0 and the media server or the client has NetBackup 7.7.
This error can also occur if the wrong parameters are used when you run a command
line.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ Check the NetBackup Problems report for clues.

■

If the error occurs when you run a command on the command line, verify that
the parameters are valid.

■ This status code may occur if nbjm passes parameters but does not have a

required parameter. Check the nbjm unified logs (originator ID 117) for the list
of parameters that were passed.

■ The following information pertains to NetBackup Snapshot Client.

■

If the following appears in the /usr/openv/netbackup/logs/bptm log as
enabled on a third-party copy backup, multiplexing was enabled on a
third-party copy backup:
bptm: cannot perform Third-Party-Copy for multiplexed backups
send_brm_msg: ERROR 20

bptm: EXITING with status 20
The Third-party Copy Device off-host backup method is incompatible with
multiplexing (the writing of two or more concurrent backup jobs to the same
storage device). You must disable multiplexing for any third-party copy
backups. If multiplexing is enabled, the backup fails.

■ The media server may not have the correct 3pc.conf file entry for the client

disk that is needed for the backup.
The following appears in the /usr/openv/netbackup/logs/bpbkar log:
14:45:00.983 [15773] <4> bpmap_mm_get_devid: GET_DEVICE_INDEX 1

This shows that a particular device cannot be found in the 3pc.conf file on
the media server (14:47:02.031 [15773] <16> bpmap_send_extend: ERR
- can't obtain device id string EMC:SYMMETRIX:601092014000).
The problem is one of the following:
■ The 3pc.conf file on the media server is outdated. Recreate the 3pc.conf

file.

■ The media server is not on the same Fibre Channel network as the

third-party copy device and client disk. As a result, the 3pc.conf file does
not have a correct entry for the client disk. Run the bptpcinfo command
with the -x client_name option; this option adds the client disk to the
3pc.conf file. For each disk that is added to the file by means of
bptpcinfo -x client_name, you may need to add the device’s World
Wide Name (WWN=).

See the NetBackup Snapshot Client Configuration online document.
See Snapshot Client Assistance in the NetBackup Snapshot Client
Administrator’s Guide.

■ The HP VxFS snapshot mechanism requires a dedicated cache partition for

each snapshot. A check is made in the mount table to make sure that the
cache partition is not already in use. If the cache partition is already in use,
status code 20 occurs.
Check the /usr/openv/netbackup/logs/bpbkar log for a message similar
to the following:
bpfsmap: FTL - bpfsmap: snapshot cache already in use,
/dev/arrayvg/vol4c
bpbkar Exit: ERR - bpbkar FATAL exit status = 20: invalid
command parameter
bpbkar Exit: INF - EXIT STATUS 20: invalid command parameter

If the snapshot cache partition is already in use, do one of the following: Set
up your policy schedules to run at different times or use different cache
partitions for each backup.
If the Allow multiple data streams option is enabled, each stream must
have its own dedicated cache partition.

NetBackup status codes

■ Compare the NetBackup version level on the server to the version level on the

clients by doing the following:
■ On UNIX or Linux NetBackup servers and clients, check the

/usr/openv/netbackup/bin/version file.
■ On Windows NetBackup servers, check the

install_path\Netbackup\version.txt file or the About NetBackup item
on the Help menu.

■

■ On Microsoft Windows clients, check the About NetBackup item on the

Help menu.
If a Java interface displays the error, tell them how to enable the debug print
manager in the Java startup file. Retry and compare the parameters that
were logged on the Java log with the parameters listed in the commands
usage statement.

■ For the Backup Media Server option for VMware backups, the storage unit that
is specified in the policy must be unique to your media servers. If the storage
unit is also available on another media server, the snapshot job cannot succeed.
If these actions do not reveal the problem, create a debug log directory for the
process that returned this status code (if the process uses legacy logging). Then
retry the operation and check the resulting log.

NetBackup status code: 25

Message: cannot connect on socket
Explanation: A process that timed out while it connects to another process for a
particular operation. This problem can occur in the following situation: when a
process tries to connect to the NetBackup request daemon (bprd) or database
manager daemon (bpdbm) and the daemon is not running. (On Windows, these
daemons are the NetBackup Request Manager and the NetBackup Database
Manager services.)
It can also occur in the following situations: the network or server is heavily loaded
and has slow response time or an evaluation license key for NetBackup expired.
However, the most common cause of this error is a host name resolution problem.
The following are other possible causes of this error caused by network connectivity
issues or a required process such as pbx_exchange not running.
■ nbjm is unable to connect to bpcd on the media server
■ nbpem is unable to connect to nbproxy
■ bptm on the media server is unable to connect to nbjm on the master server.
■ You cannot perform an immediate backup operation.
These errors are caused either by network connectivity issues or if a required
process such as pbx_exchange is not running.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ Verify that bpcompatd, vnetd, and Private Branch Exchange (PBX) are running.

Information on how to start PBX is available.

■ The following information applies only to a UNIX or Linux NetBackup master

server:
Verify that the bprd and the bpdbm processes are running. If these processes
are not running, start them. On a Windows master server, verify that the
NetBackup Request Manager and the NetBackup Database Manager services
are running. If these services are not running, start them.
If these processes or services are running, examine the All Log Entries report
for the time of the failure to determine where the failure occurred.
Do one of the following:

■

■

If you cannot view the report or you get a cannot connect on socket error,
verify again that the NetBackup Database Manager service or daemon is
running. Then, create a debug log directory for bpdbm, retry the operation,
and check the resulting debug log.
If you view the report and do not find a problem-related entry, create the
debug log directories for the related processes that were running when the
error first appeared. (This process frequently is bpbrm.) Then, retry the
operation and check the resulting debug logs.

■ Verify that the server list specifies the correct master server.

■ The following information applies only to Windows systems:

The master server is designated in the Server to use for backups and
restores drop-down in the Specify NetBackup Machines and Policy Type
dialog box. To display this dialog box, start the Backup, Archive, and Restore
interface and click Specify NetBackup Machines and Policy Type on the
File menu.

■ The following information applies only to UNIX and Linux systems:

The master server is the first SERVER entry in the bp.conf file.

■ Check the following Veritas Support website to ensure that all recommended

■ The following information applies only to UNIX systems:

If bpdbm has quit when the shutdown script runs on a media server, carefully
read the K77netbackup script. It contains details on how to prevent this
problem. The script is in /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/goodies.

If you change the server list on a master server, stop, and restart the following:
The NetBackup Database Manager and request daemons (UNIX) or the
NetBackup Database Manager and NetBackup Request Manager services
(Windows).

■ Check the services file.

■ The following information applies only to UNIX systems:

Verify that the /etc/services file (and NIS services if NIS is used) has
entries for the NetBackup services: bpcd, bpdbm, and bprd.

On Windows, verify that the %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\services
file has the correct entries for bpcd, bpdbm, and bprd.
Also, verify that the following numbers match the settings in the services file:
The NetBackup Client Service Port and the NetBackup Request Service
Port on the Network tab in the NetBackup Client Properties dialog box. To
display this dialog box, start the Backup, Archive, and Restore interface and
click NetBackup Client Properties on the File menu. The values on the
Network tab are written to the services file when the NetBackup Client service
starts.
See Verifying host names and service entries in NetBackup in the NetBackup
Troubleshooting Guide.

■ On Sun Solaris, verify that all operating system patches are installed

See the Operating Notes section of the NetBackup Release Notes.

■ On Windows, verify that the recommended service packs are installed.
■ When the base NetBackup license key expires, daemons (such as bprd and
bpdbm) terminate on the NetBackup server. If these daemons are not running,
you are likely to encounter status code 25 errors in the Administration console.
Install a valid base NetBackup license key, restart the daemons, and restart the
console.

■ For NetBackup Snapshot Client, the following applies: When many devices are

configured on a media server, it may take a long time for the bptpcinfo
command to generate the file 3pc. When the backup is run for the first time, the
backup may fail with status 25. Make sure that the
/usr/openv/volmgr/database/3pc.conf file exists. If it does, rerun the backup.
If the backup fails again, run the bptpcinfo manually to generate the file 3pc,
then try the backup again.

NetBackup status code: 37

Message: operation requested by an invalid server
Explanation: An invalid media server or Windows NetBackup Remote
Administration Console made a request to the NetBackup request daemon (bprd)
or NetBackup Database Manager daemon (bpdbm). On Windows, these daemons
are the NetBackup Request Manager and NetBackup Database Manager services.
Recommended Action: Examine the NetBackup All Log Entries report for the
time of this error to determine which system tried to connect to the master server.
If the server is a valid media server, verify that the storage unit for the media server
is defined. Also, verify that the server or Windows NetBackup Remote Administration
Console has a server list entry on the master server.
If necessary, update the server list.
On a UNIX or Linux master server, add a SERVER = media_server_name to the
bp.conf file. media_server_name is the host name of the media server. On a
Windows master server, add the media server to the list on the Servers tab in the
Master Server Properties dialog box.
See "Using the Host Properties window to access configuration settings" in the
NetBackup Troubleshooting Guide.

NetBackup status codes

If a server or Windows NetBackup Remote Administration Console has more than
one host name (for example, multiple network interfaces), verify that the master
server has a server list entry for each of them.
If you change the server list on a UNIX or Linux master server, for the changes to
take effect do the following: stop and restart the NetBackup Request daemon (bprd)
and NetBackup Database Manager daemon (bpdbm). If you change the server list
on a Windows master server, stop, and restart the NetBackup Request Manager
and NetBackup Database Manager services.

NetBackup status code: 40

Message: network connection broken

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

79

Explanation: The connection between the client and the server was broken. This
status code can also appear if the connection is broken between the master and
the media server during a backup.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ Try pinging the client from the server. If pinging is not possible, check for loose

connections or other network problems.

■ Verify that the server list settings are correct on both the client and the server.
If the backup involves a media server, verify that these entries are correct on
both the master and the media server. For example, if a media server does not
have a server list entry for the master, it does not accept connections from the
master.
■ On Windows, the master server is designated on the Servers tab in the

Master Server Properties dialog box.
See "Using the Host Properties window to access configuration settings" in
the NetBackup Troubleshooting Guide.

■ On UNIX and Linux systems, the master server is the first SERVER entry in

the bp.conf file.

If you change the server list on a UNIX or Linux master server, you must stop
and restart the NetBackup Request daemon (bprd) and NetBackup Database
Manager daemon (bpdbm) in order for the changes to take effect. On Windows,
stop and restart the NetBackup Request Manager and NetBackup Database
Manager services.

■ Status code 40 can also be due to denial of a mount request by the operator.
■ This status code may occur if nbjm was unable to connect to bpbrm or to bpmount.

Examine the nbjm unified log (originator ID 117) or the bpbrm or the bpmount
legacy logs for more detail on the cause of the error.

Base about this status code.

NetBackup status code: 41

Message: network connection timed out
Explanation: The possible causes include the following:
■ The server did not receive any information from the client for too long a period

of time.

■ You have attempted to back up too many files using FSCP (File level fast single

copy backup) with fast backup enabled.

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

80

■ NetBackup uses the available bandwidth to it's maximum potential and pushes

the requests accordingly; however, the Amazon S3 compliant cloud cannot
process the high number of requests.
The cloud vendor returns error 503 to slow down the requests and the backup
job fails with the following errors:
In the media server, bptm logs the following:
bptm:4940:<media_server_name>: AmzResiliency:
AmzResiliency::getRetryType cURL error: 0, multi cURL error: 0,
HTTP status: 503, XML response: SlowDown, RetryType: RETRY_EXHAUSTED

In the media server, bpbrm logs the following:
bpbrm Exit: client backup EXIT STATUS 41: network
connection timed out

This issue occurs only if a higher bandwidth is available between NetBackup
and the cloud storage.

Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:

■

If you back up too many files, use Host Properties on the NetBackup server
to change Client read timeout to a much higher value (e.g., 4000). These
settings are on the Universal Settings tab in the Master Server Properties
dialog box. The default for this timeout is 300 seconds.
Also, set the File browse timeouton the Timeouts tab to a value greater than
4000.
Then retry the operation. The names of the files are logged on the debug log
file in the /usr/openv/netbackup/logs/bpbkar directory before bpbkar
processes them. The last file in the log is the file that causes problems.

■ On UNIX, Linux, or Windows clients, check for the following problems with the

bpbkar client process.
On Windows clients: The bpbkar client process is not hung. Due to the files and
directories it scans, it has not replied to the server within the Client read timeout
period. This error occurs during incremental backups when directories have
thousands of unmodified files.
For this case, use Host Properties on the NetBackup server to change Client
read timeout. This setting is on the Universal Settings tab in the Master Server
Properties dialog box. The default for this timeout is 300 seconds.
See "Using the Host Properties window to access configuration settings" in the
NetBackup Troubleshooting Guide.
You can also monitor CPU utilization to determine if this condition exists.
The following information applies only to UNIX or Linux clients:

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

81

■ The bpbkar client process is hung on a file that has a mandatory locking set.

For this case, add the following to the client’s bp.conf file:
VERBOSE

And as root on the client run the following:
touch /usr/openv/netbackup/bpbkar_path_tr
/usr/openv/netbackup/logs/bpbkar

Then retry the operation. The names of the files are logged on the debug
log file in the /usr/openv/netbackup/logs/bpbkar directory before bpbkar
processes them. The last file in the log is the file that causes problems.

Note: Also, use these procedures for other unknown bpbkar hangs.

If the problem is due to mandatory file locking, have NetBackup skip the
locked files. Set LOCKED_FILE_ACTION to SKIP in the
/usr/openv/netbackup/bp.conf file on the client.

■ The bpbkar client process is not hung. Due to the files and directories it

scans, it has not replied to the server within CLIENT_READ_TIMEOUT or
CLIENT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT. This error occurs during backups when
directories have thousands of unmodified files or during restores of the sparse
files that have thousands of holes. For this case, try to add or modify the
CLIENT_READ_TIMEOUT value in the server’s
/usr/openv/netbackup/bp.conf file. The default for
CLIENT_READ_TIMEOUT is 300 seconds if it is not specified.

Use your system’s ps command and monitor CPU utilization to help decide
which of these conditions exist.
When you finish the investigation of the problem, delete the
/usr/openv/netbackup/logs/bpbkar directory, since the log files can become
quite large and are not deleted automatically. Also delete
/usr/openv/netbackup/bpbkar_path_tr so you do not generate larger log
files than needed the next time you create directory
/usr/openv/netbackup/logs/bpbkar.
■ On Windows systems, try the following:

■ Disable the following file:

install_path\VERITAS\NetBackup\bin\tracker.exe

■ Repair hard drive fragmentation. Try an application that is called Diskeeper

Lite, which is part of the Windows Resource Kit.

NetBackup status codes

■

■

■ Make sure that enough space is available in \temp.
If the server cannot connect to the client, create bpcd or bpbkar (UNIX, Linux,
and Windows only) debug log directories on the client. Then retry the operation
and check the resulting logs. If these logs do not provide a clue, create a bpbrm
debug log on the server. Then retry the operation and check the resulting debug
log.
If the bpbrm log has entries similar to the following, the problem is in the routing
configuration on the server:
bpbrm hookup_timeout: timed out waiting during the client hookup
bpbrm Exit: client backup EXIT STATUS 41: network connection
timed out

Verify that the client IP address is correct in the name service that is used. On
UNIX clients, if both the NIS and the DNS files are used, verify that they match.
See "Resolving network communication problems" in the NetBackup
Troubleshooting Guide.
If you use an AIX token ring adapter and the routed daemon is running, the
timeout occurs because the token ring adapter creates dynamic routes. It then
causes the routed daemon to crash.

■ For a FlashBackup client, this error occurs if the file system being backed up is
very large and has a very large number of files. It can also occur if a large number
of concurrent data streams are active at the same time. To correct it, add
CLIENT_READ_TIMEOUT to the /usr/openv/netbackup/bp.conf file and set
it to increase the timeout interval.

■ Make sure all recommended NetBackup patches are installed. Check the

following Veritas Support website for current patch information:
www.veritas.com/support

■ Add the CLIENT_READ_TIMEOUT values to the master server, media server,
and client when a NetBackup database extension product is installed. The values
should all be the same for each server. The value set is dependent on the size
of the database being backed up. More information on CLIENT_READ_TIMEOUT
is available.
See the NetBackup Administrator’s Guide, Volume II.

■ Make sure that enhanced authentication is configured correctly. For example,
the following may result in status code 41: Host A is configured to use enhanced
authentication with host B, but host B is not configured to use enhanced
authentication with host A. In this case, connections from host B to host A are
likely to fail with status code 41. Connections from host A to B are likely to fail
with authentication errors (status code 160).

■

If the Amazon S3 compliant cloud is not able to process the high number of
requests, perform one of the following:
■ Configure the bandwidth throttling to reduce the number of requests. See
"NetBackup cloud storage server connection properties" in the NetBackup
Cloud Administrator's Guide.

■ Reduce the number of read/write buffers. See "NetBackup cloud storage

server bandwidth throttling properties" in the NetBackup Cloud Administrator's
Guide.

■ Ask your cloud vendor to increase the parallel requests limit.

Message: server not allowed access
Explanation: The server tries to access a client, but access is blocked.
Possible causes are as follows:
■ The server is not listed on the client as a valid server.
■ The client was configured to require encrypted backups, but the encryption

attribute for the backup policy on the server was not selected.

■ The evaluation license for the NetBackup Encryption product has expired on

the server, but the NetBackup client was configured to require encrypted
backups. As a result, the server tries to make a non-encrypted backup of the
client. Since the client is configured to require encryption, the backup failed.

Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:

■

If the server is a valid server but is not listed on the client, add its name to the
client’s server list:
■ On Windows clients in the Specify NetBackup Machines and Policy Type
dialog box, do the following: Add the server in the Server to use for backups
and restores drop-down list. To display this dialog box, start the Backup,
Archive, and Restore interface on the client. Then click Specify NetBackup
Machines and Policy Type on the File menu.

■ On UNIX and Linux clients, add a SERVER entry in the bp.conf file.
If you continue to have problems, more information is available:
See "Resolving network communication problems" in the NetBackup
Troubleshooting Guide.
See "Verifying host names and services entries" in the NetBackup
Troubleshooting Guide.

■

■ To make non-encrypted backups of the client, set CRYPT_OPTION on the client

to allowed or denied.
Refer to the NetBackup Security and Encryption Guide.
If the NetBackup encryption evaluation license has expired on the server and
you want to continue encrypting backups of the client, do the following: Purchase
a permanent encryption license key and add it to the server. After you add the
permanent encryption license key, check the attributes of the backup policy to
make sure that encryption is selected.
To check the validity of an evaluation license key, do the following:
On Windows, go to the Help menu on the NetBackup Administration window
on the NetBackup server and select License Keys. If the evaluation key is not

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

86

listed in the NetBackup License Keys window, the key has expired. Use this
window to add the new permanent encryption key.
On UNIX, use the following command on the server:
/usr/openv/netbackup/bin/admincmd/get_license_key
Select option f to list the active license keys and features. If the evaluation key
is not listed, the key has expired. Use this command to add the new permanent
encryption key.

■ Be sure that all name resolution services (primary, load-balancing, and

secondary) are properly configured for consistent forward and reverse name
resolution of NetBackup hosts.

Message: client process aborted
Explanation: One of the following has occurred:
■ The client backup terminates abnormally. For example, a NetBackup master or
media server is shutdown or restarted when a backup or restore is in progress.

■ An administrator uses an OS-provided command line (for example, the kill

command) to kill an active process. The job status does not reflect the change
until one hour later, when the status changes to DONE and this status code is
generated.

Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ Enable detailed debug logging.

■ Create a bpbkar debug log directory (UNIX, Linux, and Windows clients

only).

■ Create a bpcd debug log directory.
■ On UNIX clients, add the VERBOSE option to the

/usr/openv/netbackup/bp.conf file.

■ On PC clients, increase the debug or log level.

See "Changing the logging level on Windows clients" in the NetBackup
Logging Reference Guide.

Retry the operation and examine the resulting logs.

■ This error may occur if nbjm terminated while a backup job was running. Examine
the unified logging files on the NetBackup server for nbjm (117) for more detail
on the error. All unified logging is written to /usr/openv/logs (UNIX) or
install_path\NetBackup\logs (Windows).

■ On UNIX clients, check for core files in the / directory.
■ On UNIX clients, check the system log (/usr/adm/messages on Solaris) for

system problems.

■ This problem can sometimes be due to a corrupt binary.

On UNIX clients, use the UNIX sum command to check the bpcd, bpbkar, and
tar binaries, which are located in /usr/openv/netbackup/bin on the client.
Reinstall them if they are not the same as in the client directory under
/usr/openv/netbackup/client on the server.
On a Windows client, check the bpinetd.exe, bpcd.exe, bpbkar32.exe, and
tar32.exe files, which are located in the install_path\NetBackup\bin folder
on the client.

NetBackup status code: 52

Message: timed out waiting for media manager to mount volume
Explanation: The requested volume was not mounted before the timeout expired.
This error can also occur if the volume is a cleaning tape but was not specified as
a cleaning tape.
Another possible cause: the last available drive has a mount request for a
non-backup (such as a restore). Then a backup that requires the same drive is
initiated before the mount completes. This error is due to the drive not being reported
as busy until the mount completes.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ Verify that the requested volume is available and an appropriate drive is ready

and in the UP state.

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

90

■

If this error occurs during a read operation (restore, duplicate, verify), the drives
could be busy. Increase the timeout for the media mount that the NetBackup
global attribute specifies, to allow more time to mount and position the media.
■ Verify that the tape is not a cleaning tape that is configured as a regular volume.
■ When an Automated Cartridge System controls the robot, verify that the ACSLS

■

system is up.
If it is an initial installation, a procedure is available.
See "Troubleshooting configuration problems" in the NetBackup Troubleshooting
Guide.

■ On Windows, check the Event Viewer Application log for the error messages

that indicate why the tape mount did not complete. On UNIX, check the system
log.

NetBackup status code: 53

Message: backup restore manager failed to read the file list
Explanation: The backup and restore manager (bpbrm) did not read the list of files
to back up or restore.
Recommended Action: Verify that the server software was installed correctly on
all NetBackup servers. If that is not the problem, do the following:
■ Create bpbrm debug log directories on the server.
■ On a UNIX or Linux NetBackup server, add the VERBOSE option to the bp.conf
file. On a Windows NetBackup server, set the Global logging level option on
the Logging tab in the Master Server Properties dialog box.
To display this dialog box, refer to the following topic:
See "Using the Host Properties window to access configuration settings" in the
NetBackup Troubleshooting Guide.
Increase the unified logging levels by using the vxlogcfg command as explained
in the following procedure:
See "About unified logging" in the NetBackup Logging Reference Guide.

■ Retry the operation and check the resulting debug logs for detailed

troubleshooting information.

Message: timed out connecting to client
Explanation: The server did not complete the connection to the client. The accept
system or Winsock call timed out after 60 seconds.
Some third-party software packages (for example, a personal firewall product) can
affect the TCP/IP stack in Windows. This action can cause a loss of connection
between the NetBackup server and the bpcd process on the client. NetBackup tries
to set SO_REUSEADDR (allows local address reuse) on the inbound socket
connection so that the port can be handed off from bpinetd.exe (the NetBackup
Client Service) to bpcd.exe. Some products may not allow this functionality due to
the various methods that can be used to violate system security.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ Perform the following procedure:

See "Resolving network communication problems" in the NetBackup
Troubleshooting Guide.

■ On UNIX clients, verify that the /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/bpcd binary exists

and that it is the correct size.

■ Check the /etc/inetd.conf file to make sure the bpcd path is correct in the

following entry:
bpcd stream tcp nowait root /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/bpcd bpcd

■ On the systems that include the following, make sure that the client name is in

the master’s /etc/hosts file: NetBackup master, media, and clients (with
NetBackup database extension products installed on one or more clients).

■ Completely uninstall the third-party software package on the client that causes

the failure. Or, contact the software manufacturer to investigate if other
configuration options or workarounds are possible.

Base about this status code.

NetBackup status code: 57

Message: client connection refused
Explanation: The client refused a connection on the port number for bpcd.
This error can occur because of the following:
■ No process listening activity occurs on the bpcd port
■ The number of connections to the bpcd port is more than the network subsystem

can handle with the listen() call

Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ For Windows NetBackup servers:

■ Make sure the NetBackup client software is installed.
■ Verify that the bpcd and bprd port numbers in the

%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\services file on the server matches
the setting on the client.

■ Verify that the NetBackup Client Service Port number and NetBackup

Request Service Port number on the Network tab in the NetBackup Client
Properties dialog match the bpcd and bprd settings in the services file. To
display this dialog, start the Backup, Archive, and Restore interface on the
server and click NetBackup Client Properties on the File menu.
The values on the Network tab are written to the services file when the
NetBackup Client service starts.

■ Verify that the NetBackup client service is running.
■ Use the following command to see if the master server returns correct

information for the client:

NetBackup status codes

install_path\VERITAS\NetBackup\bin\bpclntcmd -pn

■ On UNIX servers, do the following:

■ Make sure the NetBackup client software is installed.
■ Verify that the bpcd port number on the server (either NIS services map or

in /etc/services) matches the number in the client’s services file.

■ Additional help is available.

NetBackup status code: 59

Message: access to the client was not allowed
Explanation: The master or the media server tries to access the client, but the
client does not recognize the server as a valid server.
For the Enterprise Vault Agent: The names of all of the media servers among the
Enterprise Vault servers are not specified in the client configuration.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:

■

If the server is a valid server, verify that it is in the server list on the client. If
necessary add it as follows:
■ On Windows clients: Add the server on the Server to use for backups and
restores drop-down in the Specify NetBackup Machines and Policy Type
dialog box. To display this dialog box, start the Backup, Archive, and Restore
interface on the client. Then click Specify NetBackup Machines and Policy
Type on the File menu.

NetBackup status codes

■ On UNIX clients: Add a SERVER entry in the bp.conf file.
If you change the server list on a UNIX or Linux master server, do the following
for the changes to take effect: Stop and then restart the NetBackup Request
daemon (bprd) and NetBackup Database Manager daemon (bpdbm). On
Windows, stop and restart the NetBackup Request Manager and NetBackup
Database Manager services.

■ On Windows clients, enable bpinetd debug logging as follows:

■ Create a bpinetd debug log directory on the client.

■

Increase the debug or log level.
See "Changing the logging level on Windows clients" in the NetBackup
Logging Reference Guide.

■ Retry the backup and examine the resulting logs to determine the cause of

the failure.

■ On all clients, enable bpcd debug logging as follows:
■ Create a bpcd debug log directory on the client.
■ On a UNIX or Linux client, add the VERBOSE option to the

/usr/openv/netbackup/bp.conf file.

■ On PC clients, increase the debug or log level as explained in the debug log

topics in Chapter 3.

■ Retry the backup and examine the resulting logs to determine the cause of

the failure.

■ Check the bpcd debug log to determine the server’s peer name and what

comparisons are made.
The bpcd process compares NetBackup server list entries to the peer name of
the server that tries the connection. It rejects the connection if the names are
different. If necessary, change the server list entry on the client to match the
peer name.

■ On Windows clients, check the following:

■ Verify that NetBackup for Windows software was installed under a Windows

administrator account.
If NetBackup is under another type of account, reinstall it under an
administrator account. The installation completes successfully under a
non-administrator account except for the following: The NetBackup Client
service is not added to Windows and the NetBackup server cannot access
the client.

■ Verify that the Windows TCP/IP service specifies the domain server that

resolves names for the subnet that contains the NetBackup servers.

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

95

UNIX, Linux, and Windows clients are frequently not on the same subnet
and use different domain servers. When this condition exists, NetBackup
servers and Windows clients may be able to ping one another, but the server
still cannot access the Windows client.

■ The preceding items may not resolve this problem.

See "Resolving network communication problems" in the NetBackup
Troubleshooting Guide.
If NetBackup use multiple network interfaces with media servers, make sure
that the interface names appear in the client’s /usr/openv/netbackup/bp.conf
file.

■

■ For the Enterprise Vault Agent: See the Troubleshooting section of the

NetBackup for Enterprise Vault Agent Administrator’s Guide.

■ Be sure that all name resolution services (primary, load-balancing, and

secondary) are properly configured for consistent forward and reverse name
resolution of NetBackup hosts.

NetBackup status code: 60

Message: client cannot read the mount table
Explanation: The backup process on the client did not read the list of mounted
file systems.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ Run a df to see if the system can read the mount table.
■ On an SCO system, code 60 can occur because the mount-point path name

exceeds 31 characters (the maximum number on an SCO system). The bpbkar
debug log on the client shows a message similar to the following:
bpbkar build_nfs_list: FTL - cannot statfs net Errno: 42406

To eliminate these errors for future backups, create a mount point with a shorter
name and symbolically link the long name to the short name.

■ For detailed troubleshooting information, create a bpbkar debug log directory.

Then retry the operation and check the resulting log.

Manager service is not running.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ On Windows, use the Activity Monitor or the Services application in the Windows
Control Panel to see if the NetBackup Device Manager service is running. If it
is not running, start it. To enable verbose logging, place VERBOSE on a line by
itself in the install_path\Volmgr\vm.conf file before you start the service.

■ On UNIX, use vmps to see if ltid is running and if necessary start ltid in

verbose mode with the following command:

/usr/openv/volmgr/bin/ltid -v

Or, add a VERBOSE entry to the /usr/openv/volmgr/vm.conf file. Create the
vm.conf file if necessary.

■ On UNIX, check the system logs to verify that ltid starts.

Note: On UNIX systems, ltid, and on Windows systems, the NetBackup Device
Manager service, is used only if devices are attached to the system.

Explanation: The tape manager (bptm) did not communicate with the NetBackup
Volume Manager (vmd). This communication is required for most operations.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ On UNIX, verify that the Media Manager device daemon (ltid) and the
NetBackup Volume Manager (vmd) are running. Start them if necessary.

■ On Windows, verify that both the NetBackup Device Manager service and the

NetBackup Volume Manager service are running. Start them if necessary.

Note: ltid or the NetBackup Device Manager service is used only if devices are
attached to the system.

NetBackup status code: 82

Message: media manager killed by signal
Explanation: Another process or a user terminated the tape manager (bptm) or
disk manager (bpdm).
Recommended Action: This error should not occur in normal operation. If you
want to terminate an active backup, use the NetBackup Activity Monitor.
When you back up a DomainOS client, this error occurs after the server has not
received anything on the socket for at least 300 seconds. It causes a client read
timeout and breaks the connection. The bpbkar debug log has an entry similar to
the following:
13:22:49 [1347] <16> bpbkar: ERR - Extra output - - ECONNRESET
Connection reset by peer (UNIX/errno status)

To resolve the problem, increase the CLIENT_READ_TIMEOUT value. In this
instance, set the value to 900.

Recommended Action: For additional information, check the following:
■ NetBackup Problems report
■ Event Viewer Application log (Windows)
■ System log (UNIX)
■ Typically, this status code indicates a drive configuration problem that allows

more than one process at a time to open the device. On UNIX, the problem may
be due one or more of the following:
■ Two (or more) devices were configured that are the same physical device
(for different densities perhaps). Verify that none of the /dev files that were
used for these devices have the same major or minor numbers.

■ Links exist in the file system that allows users access to the drives.
■ The configuration for the drives was modified (in the administrator interface
or vm.conf) and the Media Manager device daemon, ltid, was not restarted.
Verify the configuration and then start ltid.

On Windows, the problem may be that the Media and Device Management
device configuration was modified but the NetBackup Device Manager service
was not restarted. Verify the configuration and restart the NetBackup Device
Manager service.

■ On Windows, make sure that the tapes are not write protected.
■ For detailed troubleshooting information:

■ Create a debug log directory for bpdm (if the device is disk) or bptm (if the

device is tape).

■ On UNIX, restartltid in the verbose mode by running the following:

/usr/openv/volmgr/bin/ltid -v

Or, add a VERBOSE entry to the /usr/openv/volmgr/vm.conf file. Create
the vm.conf file if necessary.

■ On Windows, to enable verbose logging, add VERBOSE on a line by itself in

the install_path\Volmgr\vm.conf file. Then, stop and restart the
NetBackup Device Manager service.

■ Retry the operation and check the resulting debug log files.
■ On Windows systems, look at the

install_path\VERITAS\NetBackup\db\media\errors log for a drive that
frequently produces errors.
On UNIX systems, look at the /usr/openv/netbackup/db/media/errors
log (which is also included in the

NetBackup status code: 84

Message: media write error
Explanation: The system’s device driver returned an I/O error while NetBackup
wrote to removable media or a disk file.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ For NetBackup Snapshot Client only:

If the following message appears in the /usr/openv/netbackup/bptm log, and
the values for key, asc, and ascq are all zero (0x0) as shown in this example
message:
tape error occurred on extended copy command, key = 0x0, asc =
0x0, ascq = 0x0

NetBackup Snapshot Client probably does not support your host-bus adapter
and its driver. The host-bus adapters that are supported in the release are listed
in the NetBackup Release Notes.

■ For additional information, check the following:

■ NetBackup Problems report to determine the device or media that caused

the error

■ System and error logs for the system (UNIX)
■ Event Viewer Application and System logs (Windows)

■

If NetBackup writes backups to a disk file, verify the following: The fragment
size that is configured for the disk storage unit is not greater than the maximum
file size that the operating system specifies.

■ On Windows, make sure that the tapes are not write protected.

■

■

If bpbackupdb was used to back up the NetBackup catalog to a disk path on a
UNIX or Linux system, the image you try to write may be greater than the
maximum file size that is specified by that operating system. Tape files do not
have this limit. You may have to back up the catalog to tape.

If the media is tape, check for the following:
■ A defective or a dirty drive. Clean it or have it repaired (refer to the tpclean

command for robotic drives).

NetBackup status codes

■ The wrong media type. Verify that the media matches the drive type you

use.

■ Defective media. If it is defective, use the bpmedia command to set the

■

volume to the FROZEN state so it is not used for future backups.
Incorrect drive configuration. Verify the Media and Device Management and
system configuration for the drive.
For example, on UNIX the drive may be configured for fixed mode when it
must be variable mode.

NetBackup status code: 89

Message: problems encountered during setup of shared memory
Explanation: The NetBackup processes use shared memory for some operations.
This status is returned when an error is encountered in the initialization of the shared
memory by the operating system’s APIs.
Recommended Action: Check for a shared memory problem. This error can occur
if the system cannot allocate enough shared memory. It usually occurs with
multiplexing, which increases the amount of shared memory that is required for the
operation. An entry similar to the following may be seen in a NetBackup log or
report:
system cannot allocate enough shared memory

If you see this type of message, refer to your platform vendor documentation for
instructions on how to increase shared memory on your system.

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

111

For older levels of Solaris, you may need to change one or more default System V
Shared Memory settings to prevent jobs failing with the memory allocation message,
as follows:
■ For Solaris 9, the default shminfo_shmmax value is 8 megabytes. You can place
the following line in your /etc/system file to increase this setting. A value of 32
megabytes has been used in this example. Your system may require a greater
value under some circumstances such as a high value for the NetBackup
multiplexing parameter. According to Sun Microsystems documentation, setting
this parameter to its maximum possible value has no side effects. (This parameter
is not applicable to Solaris 10).
set shmsys:shminfo_shmmax=33554432

■ For Solaris 9, the default shminfo_shmmni value is 100. You can place the

following line in your /etc/system file to increase this setting. The default value
is usually sufficient for NetBackup. In some circumstances, such as installing a
NetBackup media server on a large database server, this setting may need to
be increased. A value of 220 has been used in this example. (This parameter
is not applicable to Solaris 10).
set shmsys:shminfo_shmmni=220

Note: If you modify any of these values in the /etc/system file, you must restart
the system with boot -r for the new settings to take effect.

Refer to your vendor documentation for detailed instructions on how to modify these
values. Note that these shminfo parameters are not applicable to Solaris 10.

NetBackup status code: 90

Message: media manager received no data for backup image
Explanation: The tape manager (bptm) or disk manager (bpdm) received no data
when it performed a backup, archive, or duplication. This error can occur for
incremental backups where no data was backed up because no files have changed.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ Check the All Log Entries report.

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

112

■ For detailed debug information, create bpdm or bptm debug log directories on
the server. If the client is Windows, also create a bpbkar debug log directory
on the client. Retry the operation and check the resulting debug logs.

■ For additional information, check the following:

■ NetBackup Problems report to determine the device or media that caused

the error

■ System and error logs for the system (UNIX)
■ Event Viewer Application log (Windows)

■ Verify the Media and Device Management and system configuration for the

drive.
For example, on UNIX, the drive may not be set for variable mode in a case
where NetBackup requires that mode.
Check the NetBackup Device Configuration Guide for drive configuration
information.

■ Verify that the Media and Device Management configuration for the backup

device matches what is specified for the storage unit in the NetBackup policy.

■ Verify that you use the correct media in the drive.
■ For detailed debug information, create a bpdm or bptm debug log directory

(whichever applies) on the server. If the client is Windows, also create a bpbkar
debug log directory on the client. Retry the operation and check the resulting
debug logs.
If the error occurred during duplication or a Vault session that uses an Alternate
Read Server to perform duplication, verify that the Alternate Read Server has
access to the source media.

NetBackup status code: 92

Message: media manager detected image that was not in tar format
Explanation: When you performed a restore, the tape manager (bptm) or disk
manager (bpdm) did not find a tar header at the offset it expected.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ Perform a bpverify of the affected image to determine if it is written correctly.
■ Check the NetBackup Problems report for additional information about the error.
■ Verify the Media and Device Management and system configuration for the

drive.
For example, if you do not configure the drive for variable-mode block size writes
on some UNIX systems, the backup images that write to the media produce this
error when you attempt to restore the image.
The following sequence of events occurs:
■ Backup succeeds.
■ Verify succeeds.
■ Restore fails.
The bptm debug log shows an error similar to the following:
00:58:54 [2304] <16> write_data: write of 32768 bytes indicated
only 29696 bytes were written, errno = 0

In this case, configure the drive for variable-mode block sizes and suspend the
media that writes on that device.
See the NetBackup Device Configuration Guide.

NetBackup status codes

114

The images that were written to those media may be restorable (platform
dependent), but single file restores are almost guaranteed to fail. You can expire
these media and regenerate the backups. Or you can attempt to duplicate the
images on these media to another device and then expire the original copy.

■ This error has occurred on re-labeled and value-added 8-mm tape drives where
the drive’s micro code incorrectly processes a forward space record SCSI
command.
If the problem is not one of those discussed, create a debug log directory for
either bpdm or bptm and retry the operation. Check the resulting debug log file.

NetBackup status code: 93

Message: media manager found wrong tape in drive
Explanation: When you load a volume for a backup or restore, the tape manager
(bptm) found a volume that loaded without the expected tape header. This error
may mean that volumes in a robot are not in the slots that are indicated in the Media
and Device Management volume configuration.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:

■

■

If the volume is in a robot and the robot supports barcodes, perform a Compare
Contents with Volume Configuration robot inventory (on Windows) or
Compare robot contents with volume configuration robot inventory (UNIX).
The resulting report shows the media ID that was found and validates its slot
number with what is in the volume configuration. Then, either change the physical
location in the robot or change the volume configuration to show the correct
slot.
If the volume was mounted on a nonrobotic drive, verify that the correct volume
was mounted and assigned.

NetBackup status code: 96

Message: unable to allocate new media for backup, storage unit has none available
Explanation: The NetBackup Resource Broker (nbrb) did not allocate a new
volume for backups. This error indicates that the storage unit has no more volumes
available in the volume pool that is specified for this backup. Note that NetBackup
does not change storage units during the backup.
Recommended Action: Check the NetBackup Problems report to determine the
storage unit that is out of media.

■

If the storage unit is a robot with empty slots, add more volumes (remember to
specify the correct volume pool).

■

If there are no empty slots, move some media to nonrobotic and then add
new volumes.

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

116

■

If you have difficulty keeping track of your available volumes, try the
available_media script:
On UNIX, this script is in:
/usr/openv/netbackup/bin/goodies/available_media

On Windows, the script is in:
install_path\NetBackup\bin\goodies\available_media.cm
d

This script lists all volumes in the volume configuration, and augments that
list with information on the volumes currently assigned to NetBackup.

■ Set up a scratch volume pool as a reserve of unassigned tapes. If NetBackup
needs a new tape and none are available in the current volume pool, it does
the following: Moves a tape from the scratch pool into the volume pool that the
backup uses.
If the storage unit and volume pool appear to have media, verify the following:
■ Volume is not FROZEN or SUSPENDED.

■

Check for this condition by using the NetBackup Media List report. If the
volume is frozen or suspended, use the bpmedia command to unfreeze or
unsuspend it (if that is wanted).
See "Frozen media troubleshooting considerations" in the NetBackup
Troubleshooting Guide.

■ Volume has not expired or exceeded its maximum number of mounts.
■ The EMM database host name for the device is correct.

If you change the EMM database host name, stop and restart the following:
The Media Manager device daemon, ltid, (if the server is UNIX or Linux)
or the NetBackup Device Manager service (if the server is a Windows
system).

■ The correct host is specified for the storage unit in the NetBackup

configuration.
The host connection should be the server (master or media) with drives
connected to it.

■ The Media and Device Management volume configuration has media in the
correct volume pool. Unassigned or active media is available at the required
retention level.
Use the NetBackup Media List report to show the retention levels, volume
pools, and status (active and so on) for all volumes. Use the NetBackup
Media Summary report to check for active volumes at the correct retention
levels.

■ The NetBackup bptm process is rejected when it requests media from the vmd

process (UNIX) or the NetBackup Volume Manager service (Windows). The
cause of this problem is that the process or service cannot determine the name
of the host that makes the request.
This error can be due to an incorrect network configuration that involves the
following:
■ Multiple network interfaces
■ /etc/resolv.conf on those UNIX or Linux systems that use it
■ Running DNS with reverse addressing not configured

■ Create bptm and vmd debug log directories and retry the operation.
■ Examine the bptm debug log to verify that bptm connects to the correct system.

If an error is logged, examine the vmd log.
On UNIX, the vmd log is:
/usr/openv/volmgr/debug/daemon/log.xxxxxx

On Windows, the vmd log is:
install_path\Volmgr\debug\daemon\xxxxxx.log

■

If this storage unit is new and this attempt to use it is the first, stop and restart
NetBackup on the master server.

Message: error requesting media (tpreq)
Explanation: The tape manager (bptm) received an error when it requested a
media mount from the NetBackup Device Manager service (Windows) or the Media
Manager device daemon (ltid) (UNIX).
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ Check the NetBackup Problems report to determine the reason for the failure.
The most common cause is that the NetBackup Device Manager service (on
Windows) or the Media Manager device daemon (ltid) (on UNIX) is not running.
Start it if necessary.
If you duplicate backups or use Vault to duplicate backups, this error could
indicate the following: The Alternate Read Server does not have access to the
tape where the original backup resides.

Message: NDMP backup failure
Explanation: The paths in your NDMP policy file list did not back up successfully.
One of the following occurred:
■ None of the backup paths exist on the NDMP host.
■ An NDMP backup uses a wildcard character that points to a file, not a file path.
Recommended Action: Do the following:
■ Check the NetBackup All Log Entries report for more information.
■ Try the following commands from another master server or media server:

# tpautoconf -verify ndmp_filer
# tpautoconf -probe ndmp_host

On the filer, verify that the NDMP service is running. The verification process
depends on the filer.
For NetApp, run ndmpd status to verify that the NDMP daemon is running. If
not, execute ndmpd on and re-run ndmpd status to verify.

■ Change the NDMP wildcard to specify path names only. You cannot use a

wildcard character that also matches a file name. For example, an NDMP backup
selection is /vol/vol_archive_01/autoit*. This specification matches path
name /vol/vol_archive_01/autoit_01/, bit it also matches file
name/vol/vol_archive_01/autoit-v1-setup.exe.

appropriate) by creating debug log directories for them.
On UNIX, if a nonroot user has problems, verify that the directory that was
created has mode 666. Look for and correct any reported errors.

■ Retry the operation and check the resulting logs.

If the logs do not reveal the problem, use the command-line version of the

NetBackup status code: 103

Message: error occurred during initialization, check configuration file
Explanation: NetBackup Snapshot Client can perform two kinds of off-host backups
by means of a data mover: the NetBackup media server method or the Third-Party
Copy Device method. For either method, an off-host data mover backup requires
a configuration file (the 3pc.conf file) to identify the following devices on the SAN:
■ The client disks to back up
■ The devices on which to store the data
If the media server has access to many disks and storage devices on the SAN, it
may take too long to acquire the device information from the SAN. As a result, if
no 3pc.conf file exists on the media server, the first multistream backup that uses
a data mover method may fail.
Recommended Action: Create the 3pc.conf file manually before running the first
multistream data mover backup. Use the following command to create the 3pc.conf
file:
# bptpcinfo -a

The 3pc.conf file is created at /usr/openv/volmgr/database/3pc.conf.
More information is available on the 3pc.conf file and how to create it.

■ Verify that the files exist and that the permissions allow NetBackup to access

them.

■ Some NDMP servers do not support directory-level expansion. Some NDMP

filer vendors do not have the APIs that Veritas uses to support wildcard
characters lower than the volume level. For example, /fs1/dir* is not a supported
backup selection specification on EMC filers.

NetBackup status code: 108

Message: Action succeeded but auditing failed
Explanation: The primary action being audited has succeeded but the
corresponding audit record has failed because it was never created.
For example, you use the bppolicynew command to create a policy and it returns
status code 108. The policy is created successfully, but the associated audit record
does not appear in the audit report that the nbauditreport command generates.
This error can be returned only if auditing is enabled using the nbemmcmd command.

Recommended Action: Do the following:
■ Ensure that the nbaudit daemon (NetBackup Audit Manager) is running.
■ Examine the logs responsible for the primary action and the nbaudit logs for
more details on the cause of the error. For example, check the bpdbm logs for
policy creation.

NetBackup status code: 109

Message: invalid date specified
Explanation: This error can occur when you run a command on the command line
that contains a date option. The format of a date option can vary depending on the
locale of the master server.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:

■

If the error occurred on a command line, examine the standard error output from
the command for an explanatory message.

■ Refer to the format for the date options in the usage statement for the command.
Look up the locale of the master server. Compare the date format of that locale
with the date format on the usage statement for the command.

■ Check the NetBackup Problems report for clues.

■

■

If the error appears in a Java interface, enable the debug print manager in the
Java startup file. Retry and compare the parameters that are logged in the Java
log with the parameters listed in the command’s usage statement.
If these actions do not reveal the problem, create a debug log directory for the
process that returned this status code. Then retry the operation and check the
resulting debug log.

NetBackup status code: 116

Message: VxSS authentication failed
Explanation: On either end of a socket connection, the parties did not mutually
authenticate each other.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ Ensure that the Veritas Product Authentication Service is installed and configured.
For complete installation instructions, see the NetBackup Security and Encryption
Guide available from the following location:
http://www.veritas.com/docs/DOC5332

■ Check that both parties have a valid certificate. Examine the expiry date that is

listed from a bpnbat -WhoAmI. For example:
bpnbat -WhoAmI
Name: JDOG
Domain: MYCOMPANY
Issued by: /CN=broker/OU=root@machine1.mycompany.com/O=vx
Expiry Date: Sep 19 12:51:55 2009 GMT
Authentication method: Microsoft Windows

■

Operation completed successfully.
Shows an expiry date of September 19th, 2009. After 12:51:55 GMT this
credential is no longer valid and a new credential is required.
If you run from the NetBackup Administration Console, close and reopen the
console. The console automatically obtains a credential for the currently logged
in identity, if possible. By default, these certificates are valid for 24 hours. The
following is an example of how to extend the credential beyond 24 hours to 30
days (2592000 seconds):
Windows: <install path>\veritas\netbackup\sec\at\bin\vssat
setexpiryintervals -p <plugin_name> -t <user> -e 2592000

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

125

UNIX: usr/openv/netbackup/sec/at/bin/vssat setexpiryintervals -p
<plugin_name> -t <user> -e 2592000

■ Ensure that the certificates for both sides use the same broker or are children

of the same root broker and that trusts are established between them.
See the NetBackup Security and Encryption Guide for more information on
broker hierarchies and how to establish trust relationships between brokers.

■ Ensure that connectivity between the physical systems in question is possible.
If general sockets cannot connect between the computers (such as ping and
telnet), issues within the network unrelated to NetBackup can cause this
problem.

■ Ensure that the system has sufficient swap space and the following directories

are not full:
■ /home/username
■ /usr/openv/netbackup/logs
■ /tmp

Base about this status code.

NetBackup status code: 117

Message: VxSS access denied
Explanation: The user identity that was used to attempt an operation does not
have the permissions that are needed to perform the action.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:

■

If you use the default groups, make certain that the user attempts to perform an
operation appropriate for that group. For example, a member of NBU_Operators
is unable to modify policy information, which is a permission reserved for
administrator roles.

■ Ensure that the system has sufficient swap space and the following directories

are not full:
■ /home/username
■ /usr/openv/netbackup/logs
■ /tmp

■

If you use your own defined groups and permissions, first determine the object
with which the operation is associated. Then, add the permissions relative to
the action. For example, a user is required to up and down drives but currently

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

126

does not have permission to do so. Verify that the user belongs to the correct
authorization group.
If necessary, verify that the group has Up and Down permissions on the Drive
object within the Group Permission tab. If necessary, increase the verbosity
level of NetBackup to locate what object and what permissions are required for
the failing request. The pertinent lines in the debug logs look similar to the
following:
17:19:27.653 [904.872] <2> GetAzinfo: Peer Cred Info.
Name: JMIZZLE
Domain: MYCOMPANY
Expiry: Sep 24 21:45:32 2003 GMT

17:19:40.171 [904.872] <2> VssAzAuthorize: vss_az.cpp.5166:
Function: VssAzAuthorize. 20 Permission denied.

In this example, the user JMIZZLE attempts to perform an operation that requires
the Up permission on the Drives object. To diagnose the problem, examine the
group(s) to which the user belongs to ensure that the appropriate group includes
the Up permission. (Up is a member of the Operate permission set for Drives.)
If you have performed disaster recovery and are now running catalog recovery
using the Remote Administration Console, you need to restart the master
server services. After the restart, if you do not logout from the Remote
Administration Console and try to access the Security Management tab, you
will receive this error message and must log in again.

NetBackup status code: 118

Message: VxSS authorization failed
Explanation: NetBackup was unable to complete the authorization check against
the authorization service.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ Ensure that the Veritas Product Authorization Service or daemon is running.

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

127

See the NetBackup Security and Encryption Guide for more information on
authentication and authorization daemons.

■ Ensure that you are in communication with the correct master server. Within

the bp.conf files on the local server, verify that the entry
AUTHORIZATION_SERVICES specifies the proper host name (fully qualified) of the
authorization service. For example, AUTHORIZATION_SERVICE =
machine2.mycompany.com 0 specifies that the server contacts machine2 to
perform authorization checks. Also ensure that this entry matches that of the
master server.

■ Ensure that the system has sufficient swap space and the following directories

are not full:
■ /home/userName
■ /usr/openv/netbackup/logs
■ /tmp

■ Ensure that the server that contacts the master has a valid certificate. The

computer certificate can be examined as follows:
For UNIX:
# bpnbat -WhoAmI -cf
/usr/openv/var/vxss/credentials/machine3.mycompany.com

For Windows:
Bpnbat WhoAmI -cf "c:\Program
Files\VERITAS\NetBackup\var\vxss\credentials\machine3.my
company.com"

Both of which would return:
Name: machine3.mycompany.com
Domain: NBU_Machines@machine2.mycompany.com
Issued by: /CN=broker/OU=root@machine2.mycompany.com/O=vx
Expiry Date: Sep 2 19:25:29 2004 GMT
Authentication method: Veritas Private Security
Operation completed successfully.

If the expiry date was exceeded, use bpnbat -LoginMachine to obtain a new
credential for the computer.
See the NetBackup Commands Reference Guide for more information on bpnbat.
The server that attempts the check is not authorized to examine the authorization
database. Ensure that bpnbaz -ShowAuthorizers re-tuned the computer's

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

128

identity. Ensure that the computer has a computer credential under the directory
as follows:
Program Files\VERITAS\var\vxss\credentials (Windows)
/usr/openv/var/vxss/credentials (UNIX)
This credential should have the full name of the computer as in the following
example: machine1.company.com.

■ Check that the maximum number of open sockets to the authorization database
was not exhausted. Use netstat to determine the number of sockets that are
opened to port 4032 on the authorization server and that refer to the following
configurations:
Windows:
HKLM\SOFTWARE\VERITAS\Security\Authorization\Communication\ClientMaxConnections
UNIX: /etc/vx/vss/VRTSaz.conf entryClientMaxConnections
If the maximum number of open connections was reached, you may need to
increase the number of maximum open connections. An increase in the number
of open connections increases the memory footprint of the authorization service
or daemon. Note that extreme increases in the maximum number of connections
can cause performance degradation.

NetBackup status code: 129

Message: Disk storage unit is full
Explanation: As NetBackup writes to the file system for the disk storage unit, runs
out of space. Until more file system space is available, images of similar size or
larger may fail with this error when written to this disk storage unit.
In a scheduled backup job that writes to a storage unit group (which contains this
disk storage unit), the following occurs: the NetBackup scheduler requests the
storage unit with the greatest available capacity when the job is retried.
For the retry, when the scheduler requests the storage unit with the greatest available
capacity, note the following:

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

132

■ A tape storage unit in the storage unit group has preference over any disk storage

■

■

units since tape storage units usually have more capacity.
If the storage unit with the most unused capacity is busy, NetBackup skips it.
NetBackup then selects an available storage unit with the next largest, unused
capacity.
If the storage unit with the greatest unused capacity is the one that lacked
capacity when the job first failed, the scheduler tries it again. That storage unit
may have more unused capacity now than it did when the job failed.

Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ Either free sufficient space or add more space to the file system for this storage

unit.

■ Lower the high capacity mark for this disk storage unit. Configure the policies
to access it through a storage unit group that provides alternative storage to
use when this storage unit fills up. Ideally, if an image exceeds the file system’s
high capacity mark, it also completes successfully. This image leaves the storage
unit in a full state (over the high capacity mark). The storage unit then is not
assigned to other jobs until its capacity falls under its high capacity mark.
If the Staging attribute is set on the disk storage unit that did not have enough
capacity, it may be unable to create free space. It cannot create space because
the backups that are staged to the disk are not relocated (eligible to be deleted
from the staging storage unit). Ensure that staging’s relocation (duplication) jobs
successfully copy enough images to provide sufficient free space for new
backups.

NetBackup status code: 131

Message: client is not validated to use the server
Explanation: The client name, as determined from the connection to the server,
did not match any client name in the NetBackup configuration. No altnames
configuration for this client exists on the master server. A client and server with
multiple network connections can encounter this problem in the following situation:
the name by which the client is configured is not the one by which its routing tables
direct connections to the server.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ Examine the NetBackup Problems report.
■ Create a debug log directory for bprd and retry the operation. Check the resulting

debug log to determine the connection and the client names.
Depending on the request type (restore, backup, and so on), you may need or
want to do the following:
■ Change the client’s configured name.
■ Modify the routing tables on the client.
■ On the master server, set up an altnames directory and file for this client.

See the NetBackup Administrator’s Guide, Volume I.

NetBackup status code: 133

Message: invalid request
Explanation: One of the following has occurred:
■ You make an unrecognizable request. This lack of recognition usually results

from different versions of NetBackup software being used together.

■ A client receives this error in response to a list or restore request. The

DISALLOW_CLIENT_LIST_RESTORE or DISALLOW_CLIENT_RESTORE option exists
in the bp.conf file on a UNIX NetBackup server or in the registry on a Windows
NetBackup server. These options deny list and restore requests from all
NetBackup clients.

Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:

■

■

If you suspect that the software versions are the problem, verify that all
NetBackup software is at the same version level.
■ On UNIX NetBackup servers and clients, check the

/usr/openv/netbackup/bin/version file.
■ On Windows NetBackup servers, check the

install_path\netbackup\version.txt file or the About NetBackup item
on the Help menu.

■ On Microsoft Windows clients, check the About NetBackup item on the

Help menu.

If the server denies list and restore requests, do one of the following:
■ Go to the NetBackup Administration Console. In the left pane, expand

NetBackup Management > Host Properties > Master Servers. In the right
pane, double-click the master server you want to modify. In the properties
dialog box, in the left pane, select Client Attributesto access the Allow
client browse and Allow client restore options.

■ Remove the DISALLOW_CLIENT_LIST_RESTORE and

DISALLOW_CLIENT_RESTORE options from the bp.conf file on a UNIX
NetBackup server or from the registry on a Windows NetBackup server.
Then, stop and restart the NetBackup request daemon (UNIX) or NetBackup
Request Manager service (Windows).

■ For detailed troubleshooting information, create bpdbm, bprd, and admin debug

log directories. Retry the operation and check the resulting debug logs.

NetBackup status code: 134

Message: unable to process request because the server resources are busy
Explanation: Status code 134 is an informational message that indicates that all
drives in the storage unit are currently in use. If all drives are in use, NetBackup
automatically tries another storage unit. If one is not available, NetBackup re-queues
the job with a status of 134 and retries it later.
Recommended Action: None
The 134 code is an informational message only and is not considered an error. It
can occur for a number of reasons in normal operation. The 134 status code can
occur more frequently in an SSO environment. No action is necessary.
A status 134 is not logged in the error logs. A 134 status causes a new try to appear
in the Activity Monitor. It does not increase the retry count that is associated with
the allowed number of retries.

NetBackup status code: 136

Message: tir info was pruned from the image file
Explanation: The TIR information was pruned from one or more of the component
(differential or cumulative) backup images being synthesized.
This situation arises when the following occurs:
■ The most recent backup image for the client is a synthetic full or cumulative

backup

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

136

■ The TIR information from one or more of the component images before the

synthetic full (or cumulative) backup is pruned

The TIR information is automatically restored to the image catalog if you expire the
synthetic backup (full or cumulative) image and try to rerun the synthetic backup
job for the client. However, the synthetic backup job fails with this error if the TIR
restore fails due to bad, missing, or vaulted media or a bad drive.
Recommended Action: Reimport the TIR information into the catalog of each
component image (from which the TIR information was pruned). Then rerun the
synthetic backup job. The TIR information can be imported into the image catalog
by initiating a true image restore of any file from that component image. The restore
process also restores the TIR information in the image catalog.

NetBackup status code: 146

Message: cannot get a bound socket
Explanation: The service or daemon did not bind to its socket. A system call fails
when the daemon (UNIX) or service (Windows) attempts to bind to its configured
port number. This error is usually caused when another process acquired the port
before the daemon or service started.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ Examine the NetBackup Problems and All Log Entries reports.
■ Create bprd and bpdbm debug log directories and retry the operation. Check

the resulting logs to see the system error message that resulted from the attempt.
If another process has the port, use other system commands to determine the
process. Based on this research, either change the port number in your services
file or map or terminate the process that acquired the port.

139

On UNIX, another possible cause for this error is the use of the kill command
to terminate bprd or bpdbm. To stop bpdbm, use the
/usr/openv/netbackup/bin/bpdbm -terminate command. Use of the kill
command to stop these processes can leave them unable to bind to their
assigned ports the next time they are started.
To identify a bprd or a bpdbm problem, look for lines similar to the following in
the debug log for the respective process:
<16> getsockbound: bind() failed, Address already in use (114)
<32> listen_loop: cannot get bound socket. errno = 114
<4> terminate: termination begun...error code = 146

Similar entries can appear in the reports.
If the problem persists longer than 10 minutes, it may be necessary to restart
the server.

NetBackup status code: 148

Message: daemon fork failed
Explanation: A NetBackup service did not create a child process due to an error
that was received from the system. This error is probably an intermittent error that
is based on the availability of resources on the system.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ Restart the service at a later time and investigate the system problems that limit

the number of processes.

■ On Windows systems, check the Event Viewer Application and System logs.

NetBackup status code: 152

Message: required value not set
Explanation: An incomplete request was made to the bpdbm process (on UNIX),
or the NetBackup Database Manager service (on Windows). This error usually
occurs because different versions of software are used together.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ Verify that all software is at the same version level.
■ For detailed troubleshooting information, create bpdbm and admin debug log

directories and retry the operation. Check the resulting debug logs.

NetBackup status code: 154

Message: storage unit characteristics mismatched to request
Explanation: A backup was tried and the storage unit selected for use had the
characteristics that were not compatible with the backup type.
Recommended Action: Verify that the characteristics of the selected storage unit
are appropriate for the attempted backup.
■ For a NetBackup Snapshot Client, the policy storage unit was set to

Any_available and the off-host backup method was set to Third-Party Copy
Device or NetBackup Media Server. Do not choose Any_available. A particular
storage unit (such as nut-4mm-robot-tl4-0) must be specified when
Third-Party Copy Device or NetBackup Media Server is specified as the
off-host backup method.

■ For an NDMP policy type, verify the following:

■ You have defined a storage unit of type NDMP.
■ The NDMP host value matches the host name of the client. For example, if
the NDMP policy specifies toaster as the client, the configuration for the
storage unit must specify toaster as the NDMP host.

■ The media server for the storage unit is running the correct version of

NetBackup.

■ For a policy type other than NDMP, verify that the policy specifies a media

manager or disk type storage unit.

NetBackup status code: 155
Message: disk is full
Explanation: The write to the catalog file failed because the disk that contains the

NetBackup status code: 156

Message: snapshot error encountered
Explanation: The following are possible causes of this status code:
■ Errors related to VMware
■ An error related to the Enterprise Vault Agent. The following errors can result

in a status code 156:
■ VSS_E_BAD_STATE snapshot error
■ VSS_E_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE snapshot error

■ A snapshot-backup related error regarding Windows Open File Backup or

Snapshot Client.

■ Multiple volumes are mounted to the same mount point
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ For NetBackup for VMware:

■ NetBackup cannot obtain the volume ID of a drive

NetBackup may not be able to obtain the volume ID of a drive. In that case,
none of the virtual machine drives are backed up. The backup fails with
NetBackup status code 156.
The drive may be down.

■ A backup of the virtual machine is already active

You cannot run more than one backup per virtual machine at a time. If you
start a second backup of the virtual machine while the first backup is active,
the second job fails with a status 156.
Recommended action: Wait until the first job completes, then run the second
one.

■ Cannot find virtual machine name

NetBackup cannot find the host name or VM display name of a virtual
machine that is listed in the backup policy. The detailed status log may
include the following error message:
Critical bpbrm (pid=<pid number>) from client <client name>:
FTL - snapshot creation failed, status 156.)

If the virtual machines do not have static IP addresses, you can configure
NetBackup to identify virtual machines by their VM display names or UUIDs.

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

143

Examples of the environments that do not use static IP addresses are
clusters, and the networks that assign IP addresses dynamically.
Note that NetBackup may have been configured to identify virtual machines
by their VM display names. In that case, make sure that the display names
are unique and that they do not contain special characters.

■ The virtual machine is turned off

Through a vCenter server, NetBackup can back up the virtual machines that
are turned off. You must provide credentials for NetBackup to access the
vCenter server.
If NetBackup uses credentials for an ESX server instead of vCenter, it may
not be able to identify a turned off virtual machine. Note the following:

■

■

If the policy uses VM host name or VM DNS name as the Primary VM
identifier, NetBackup may not find the virtual machine. The backup fails.
If the policy uses VM display name or VM UUID as the Primary VM
identifier, NetBackup can identify the virtual machine. The backup
succeeds.

■ The virtual machine has one or more independent disks and is in a suspended

state
If a virtual machine with independent disks is in a suspended state, snapshot
jobs fail. Messages similar to the following appear in the job details log:
01/12/2015 17:11:37 - Critical bpbrm (pid=10144) from client
<client name>: FTL - VMware error received: Cannot take a
memory snapshot, since the virtual machine is configured with
independent disks.

More information is available in the following VMware article:
http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1007532
As a workaround, change the state of the virtual machine to on or off, and
rerun the backup.

Note: Data on independent disks cannot be captured with a snapshot. The
rest of the virtual machine data is backed up.

■ The virtual machine's disk is in raw mode (RDM)

The RDM is ignored (not backed up) and any independent disk is recreated
but empty.

■ The attempt to create a snapshot exceeded the VMware timeout

If the attempt to create a snapshot of the virtual machine exceeds the VMware
timeout of 10 seconds, the snapshot fails with NetBackup status 156. This

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

144

timeout may occur if the virtual machine is configured with a large number
of volumes. Note that the timeout may be encountered even if the Virtual
machine quiesce option was disabled.
Do one of the following:
■ Reduce the number of volumes within the virtual machine.

■

Install a NetBackup client on the virtual machine and select another
backup method for the policy (not the VMware snapshot method).

■ The virtual machine has no vmdk file assigned

Virtual machines without vmdk files can occur in a vCenter Site Recovery
Manager (SRM) environment. If a replicated virtual machine has never been
active, it is in passive mode and may have no vmdk file(s).
You can enable the Ignore diskless VMs option on the VMware Advanced
Attributes tab of the policy. If this option is enabled: NetBackup does not
back up a replicated (passive) virtual machine in an SRM environment if that
virtual machine has no vmdk files.

■ The vmdk file has too many delta files

Whenever a VMware snapshot occurs, a delta.vmdk file is created for each
vmdk. If 32 or more such delta files exist for a single vmdk file, a NetBackup
backup of that VM may fail (status 156). The NetBackup Activity Monitor job
details contain messages similar to the following:
02/06/2015 10:33:17 - Critical bpbrm (pid=15799) from
client fl5vm1_2012: FTL - vSphere_freeze: Unable to proceed with
snapshot creation, too many existing delta files(44).
02/06/2015 10:33:17 - Critical bpbrm (pid=15799) from client
fl5vm1_2012: FTL - VMware_freeze: VIXAPI freeze (VMware snapshot)

fl5vm1_2012: FTL - vfm_freeze: method: VMware_v2, type: FIM,
function: VMware_v2_freeze

To back up the VM, do the following:
■ Consolidate the VM's snapshots.

In the VMware interface, right-click on the VM and select Snapshot >
Consolidate. For more information, see your VMware documentation.
■ Verify that each of the VM’s vmdk files now has fewer than 32 delta files.

If the snapshot consolidation was not successful, see the following
VMware article for further assistance:
http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1004545

■ Rerun the NetBackup backup.

NetBackup status codes

■ VMware snapshot quiesce operation failed

If the NetBackup policy is enabled for virtual machine quiesce (the default),
the VMware snapshot operation in vSphere initiates a quiesce of the virtual
machine. If snapshot quiesce fails, the NetBackup job fails with status 156.

■ For the Enterprise Vault Agent:

See the Troubleshooting section of the NetBackup for Enterprise Vault Agent
Administrator’s Guide.

■ For a Windows Open File Backup Snapshot Provider that uses VSS:

See the Troubleshooting section of one of the following guides:
■ NetBackup for VMware Administrator’s Guide
■ NetBackup for Hyper-V Administrator’s Guide
■ NetBackup Snapshot Client Administrator’s Guide
The VSS cache files may be too small for the number of files being backed up
using VSS.
If bpbkar debug logs are turned on, a message similar to the following appears
in the bpbkar debug log for the backup.

To increase the VSS cache size by using the Shadow Copy configuration in
Windows, do the following in the order listed:

■

■

In Windows, right-click My Computer and select Manage.
In the console tree, right-click Shared Folders, select All Tasks, and select
Configure Shadow Copies.

■ Select the volume where you want to make changes, and then select

Settings.

■

In the Settings dialog box, change the Maximum Size setting to either of
the following: No Limit or a size large enough to suit the requirements of
your installation and your usage of VSS.

■ For backups using Snapshot Client and the NAS_Snapshot method, with

or without SnapVault:

■

If the backup fails with status code 156, consult the bpfis legacy log, in
/usr/openv/netbackup/logs (UNIX) or install_path\NetBackup\logs
(Windows). If the bpfis directory does not already exist, you must create it
and rerun the job.
If necessary, increase the logging level and retry the job.
See "About logs" in the NetBackup Logging Reference Guide.

■ On Windows clients, when restoring files from a backup that is made with
the NAS_Snapshot method, log into the NetBackup Client Service as the
Administrator account, not as the local system account. Otherwise, the
backup fails with status 156.

In Windows Services, double-click the NetBackup Client Service.

■
■ Then check the Log On tab: if the service is not logged on as

Administrator, stop the service.

■ Change the logon to the Administrator account and restart the service.
■ Retry the restore.

■ For other NetBackup Snapshot Client issues:

■ The file system that is specified as a snapshot source is not mounted. In this
case, you may see the following in the /usr/openv/netbackup/logs/bpfis
log:
17:12:51 bpfis: FTL - snapshot creation failed, status 156

Make sure that the file system that is specified for the snapshot source has
been mounted.

■ The file system that is specified as the snapshot source does not correspond
to the file system that contains the actual files (as opposed to symbolic links
to the files). The mounted file system for the snapshot source must contain
the actual files, not symbolic links. If items in the file list, such as /oracle,
is a symbolic link to /export/home/oracle, the snapshot source must specify
/export, or /export/home, not /oracle.

■ VxVM is selected as the snapshot method but the snapshot source is not
configured over a Veritas Volume Manager (VxVM) volume. In this case,
you may see the following in the /usr/openv/netbackup/logs/bpfis log:

■ VxVM was selected as the snapshot method, but a Veritas Volume Manager
snapshot mirror of the snapshot source volume had not been created before
you ran the backup, or another backup is currently running that uses the
snapshot mirror. In either case, you may see the following in the
/usr/openv/netbackup/logs/bpfis log:
17:12:51 onlfi_freeze: FTL - VfMS error 11; see following

message:
17:12:51 onlfi_freeze: FTL - find_ready_snapshot: Cannot find
available snapshot mirror

See the NetBackup Snapshot Client Administrator’s Guide for information
on how to create a snapshot mirror on the client before you run the backup.
■ VxVM was selected as the snapshot method, and a Veritas Volume Manager
snapshot mirror of the snapshot source volume has been created. However,
two different backup jobs (A and B) try to back up the same volume (for
example, vol01), but job A starts before job B. After an available snapshot
mirror is found, a brief pause occurs before the snapshot is formed. Job B
that runs slightly behind job A may try to create a snapshot of the snapshot
mirror immediately before job A creates the snapshot and gets the lock on
it.
In this case, you may see the following in the
/usr/openv/netbackup/logs/bpfis log:
17:12:51 onlfi_freeze: FTL - VfMS error 11; see following
messages:
17:12:51 onlfi_freeze: FTL - Fatal method error

■ When you use nbu_snap as a snapshot method, you may have stale

snapshots if status code 156 occurs with the following messages in the
/usr/openv/netbackup/logs/bpfis log. (Stale snapshots are those that
nbu_snap did not automatically delete.)
17:12:51 onlfi_freeze: FTL - VfMS error 11; see following

■ Look for stale snapshots by running the

/usr/openv/netbackup/bin/driver/snaplist command when there are
no active backups running. If the snaplist command shows cache entries,
there are stale snapshots. Nothing is displayed if there are no stale
snapshots.
Example snaplist output:
id ident

■ Use the snapoff command to remove the stale snapshot, as follows:

■

/usr/openv/netbackup/bin/driver/snapoff id
Where id is the ID from the snaplist output (such as 43 in the preceding
example).
If a backup using the VxFS_Checkpoint snapshot method failed, the
NetBackup bpbkar process should automatically remove the clone.
Sometimes, however, bpbkar is unable to remove the clone. In this case,

Remove the clone as follows.

Note: If the checkpoint is not removed, you cannot use VxFS_Checkpoint
to back up any data in the file system where the checkpoint is mounted.

■ List the name of the checkpoint by entering the following VxFS command:

/usr/lib/fs/vxfs/fsckptadm list /file_system

Where file_system is the name of the file system where the checkpoint is
mounted. A sample output follows. In this example, /vtrax_test is the file
system and fi_ckpt is the name of the checkpoint.
/vtrax_test
fi_ckpt:
ctime = Mon Nov 12 10:08:13 2001
mtime = Mon Nov 12 10:08:13 2001
flags = largefiles

■ Remove the checkpoint by entering the following:

/usr/lib/fs/vxfs/fsckptadm remove checkpoint /file_system

■

If the checkpoint cannot be removed, unmount the checkpoint and retry the
first step in this procedure.

clone group

NetBackup automatically creates VxVM clones for TimeFinder, ShadowImage,
or BusinessCopy backups of the data that is configured over volumes. After
the backup has completed, NetBackup removes the VxVM clone. In this
case, a system crash or restart may have prevented the removal. Remove
the clone as follows.
(Do the following on the client or alternate client, depending on the type of
backup.)

■ When no backups are running, use the following VxVM command to list any

clones: vxdg list
The clone name is of the form clone_disk_group_clone.

■ To remove the clone, enter the following:

/usr/openv/netbackup/bin/bpdgclone -g disk_group -n volume -c

For example:
/usr/openv/netbackup/bin/bpdgclone -g wil_test -n vol01 -c

Where wil_test is the name of the disk group and volo1 is the name of
the VxVM volume.
For more information on how to remove a VxVM clone, see the NetBackup
Snapshot Client Administrator’s Guide. For vxdg, see the Veritas Volume
Manager Administrator’s Guide.

NetBackup automatically creates VxVM snapshots for backups of the data
that is configured over volumes. After the backup completes, NetBackup
removes the VxVM snapshot. In this case, a system crash or restart may
have prevented the removal. Remove the snapshot as follows.
For FlashSnap:
(Do the following on the client or alternate client, depending on the type of
backup.)

■ Find the VxVM disk group:

vxdg list

The format of the disk group name is as follows:

primaryhost_diskgroup_split

If vxdg list does not show the disk group, the group might have been
deported. You can discover all the disk groups including deported ones by
entering:

vxdisk -o alldgs list

The disk groups that are listed in parentheses are not imported on the local
system.

■ Deport the VxVM disk group:

NetBackup status codes

vxdg deport primaryhost_diskgroup_split

Enter the following on the primary (original) client:
Import and join the VxVM disk group:

■

vxdg import primaryhost_diskgroup_split
vxrecover -g primaryhost_diskgroup_split -m
vxdg join primaryhost_diskgroup_split diskgroup

■ Start the volume and snap back the snapshot volume:
vxvol -g primaryhost_diskgroup_split start

SNAP_diskgroup_volume

vxassist snapback SNAP_diskgroup_volume

For VVR, on the alternate client:

■ Enter the following to display unsynchronized mirror disks:

vxprint -g diskgroup

■ Enter the following to resynchronize the mirror disks:

vxassist -g diskgroup -v volume snapback

■ When you use a snapshot method such as VxFS_Checkpoint to back up a
Veritas File System (VxFS), the backup fails if the VxFS license has expired.

NetBackup status code: 159

Message: licensed use has been exceeded
Explanation: A configuration limit was exceeded.
For example, a job fails with this error code if a policy is set up that specifies the
following:
■ A storage unit that is on a SAN media server
■ A client that is not the SAN media server itself
SAN media servers can only back up themselves.
This status code is used when the creation of a storage unit on a SAN media server
fails because On demand only is not selected. On demand only is required for
storage units on a SAN media server.
Recommended Action: To determine the cause of the error, examine the
NetBackup All Log Entries report for the command that was run. See also the Activity
Monitor details for informative messages.
If the job fails on a SAN media server storage unit, ensure that only the local client
is specified in the policy. If remote clients are specified in the policy, do one of the
following: remove them and place them in a policy that specifies a different storage
unit or change the storage unit for that policy.
If you want to back up remote clients by using the SAN media server, you can
purchase a regular NetBackup media server license.

NetBackup status code: 170

Message: third party copy backup failure
Explanation: Usually indicates a problem with the 3pc.conf file or the mover.conf
file. (For detailed causes, see recommended actions.)
For more information on these files, see the NetBackup Snapshot Client
Configuration document available at the following location:
https://www.veritas.com/content/support/en_US/article.TECH51377.html
For help accessing this document, see Snapshot Client Assistance in the NetBackup
Snapshot Client Administrator’s Guide.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:

■

■

■

If a non third-party copy device is listed in 3pc.conf file, correct it or remove
the non third-party copy device entry.
If an incorrect LUN is specified in the 3pc.conf file or the device does not exist,
correct the 3pc.conf file as appropriate.
If an appropriate mover.conf file (with or without file name extension) cannot
be found, the /usr/openv/netbackup/logs/bptm log may show the following:
09:51:04 [22281] <2> setup_mover_tpc: no
mover.conf.vertex_std_tpc or mover.conf file exists, cannot
perform TPC backup
09:51:04 [22281] <16> bptm: unable to find or communicate with
Third-Party-Copy mover for policy vertex_std_tpc

Make sure that an appropriate mover.conf file exists in /usr/openv/netbackup
on the media server. This file can be any of the following:
■ mover.conf.policy_name file, where policy_name exactly matches the

name of the policy.

■ mover.conf.storage_unit_name, where storage_unit_name exactly matches

the name of the storage in the Backup Policy Management Policy
attributes dialog box (such as nut-4mm-robot-tl4-0).

■ mover.conf file (no extension) for the configurations that have only one

third-party copy device.

Note that NetBackup looks for an appropriate mover.conf file in the order.

09:50:12 [22159] <16> bptm: unable to find or communicate with
Third-Party-Copy mover for policy vertex_std_tpc

Correct the SCSI pass-through path of the third-party copy device that is entered
in the mover.conf file.
If the third-party copy device returned an error, you may see either of the
following messages in /usr/openv/netbackup/logs/bptm log:
cannot process extended copy error due to truncated sense data,
may be HBA problem
disk error occurred on extended copy command, key = 0x0, asc =

(bptm), did not find the expected tape header. This error can mean that a robotic

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

162

device volume is not in the slot number that is in the Media and Device Management
volume configuration. It also can mean that a read error (I/O error) occurred.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:

■

■

If the volume is in a robot that supports bar codes, verify the robot contents by
using a robot inventory option.
If the volume was mounted on a nonrobotic drive, verify that the correct volume
was mounted and assigned.

■ Check the NetBackup Problems report. If it shows a fatal read error, try the

■

operation again with another drive, if possible.
If your configuration has multiple servers or HBAs with access to your tape
services, make sure that the SCSI Reserve or Release is configured correctly.
(Most likely, the tape services configuration is an SSO configuration.)

NetBackup status code: 173

Message: cannot read backup header, media may be corrupted
Explanation: When the tape manager (bptm) searches for a backup image to
restore, the following occurs: it cannot find the correct backup ID at the position on
the media where NetBackup expected it. This status code can indicate a drive
hardware problem.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ Check the NetBackup Problems report for clues as to what caused the error.
■ Try the restore on another drive if possible.
■ For detailed troubleshooting information, create a debug log directory for bptm

and retry the operation. Check the resulting debug log.

Message: media manager - system error occurred

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

163

Explanation: An abnormal condition caused a tape manager (bptm) or disk manager
(bpdm) failure.
On UNIX, the file list that NetBackup generates for snapshot copy may not have
enough information to restore from the NetBackup tar copy. For example, block
number information is not correct because the NetBackup tar copy is not yet created.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ Check the NetBackup Problems report to see if it shows the cause of the

problem. If you see a Problems report message similar to the following, save
all logs and contact Veritas Technical Support:
attempted to write 32767 bytes, not a multiple of 512

■ On UNIX, if this error occurs during a restore, the tape drive may be incorrectly

configured. It may be configured to write in fixed-length mode when it should
write in variable length mode.
Verify your drive’s configuration by comparing it to what is recommended in the
NetBackup Device Configuration Guide.
If your configuration incorrectly specifies fixed-length mode, change it to variable
length mode and suspend the media that were written on that device. The images
that were written to those media may be restorable (platform dependent), but
single file restores are likely to fail.
If the problem occurs with a particular client only, verify that the client binaries
are correct, especially for bpcd.
If you can read or write any other images on this media, check the following
reports for clues:

■

■

Images on Media report

■
■ Media Contents report

■ Verify the following:

■ The media, by using the NetBackup image verify option.
■ That you used the correct media type for the device.

■ Check the system or the console log for errors (on UNIX) or the Event Viewer

Application log (on Windows).

■ For detailed debug information, create a debug log directory for either bptm or
bpdm (whichever applies) and retry the operation. Check the resulting debug
log.
On UNIX, if the bptm debug log shows an error similar to the following, the tape
drive is configured to write in fixed-length mode rather than variable length mode.

■

The image being written encountered the end-of-media.
If the backup was configured for an OpenStorage disk storage unit, the
OpenStorage vendor's plug-in may not be installed on all media servers in the
storage unit's media server list. Either install the vendor plug-in on all of the
media servers or remove from the list the servers that do not have the plug-in
installed.

■ On UNIX, if this error occurs during a restore, refresh the Backup, Archive,

and Restore client console and retry the restore. This action refreshes the file
list displayed in the client console and passes the correct information about the
selected files.

NetBackup status code: 175

Message: not all requested files were restored
Explanation: When the bptm or the bpdm process restores files from an image, it
detected a fatal error condition and terminated the restore before it completed.
Under normal circumstances, this error should not occur.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ Check the NetBackup Problems report and the status lot or the progress log on

the client for additional information about the error.

■ For detailed troubleshooting information, create a debug log directory for either
bptm or bpdm (whichever applies) and retry the operation. Check the resulting
debug log.

NetBackup status code: 176

Message: cannot perform specified media import operation
Explanation: The tape manager (bptm) detected an error condition when it tried
to import a specific backup image.
Possible reasons for this error are as follows:
■ Media ID is already active in the NetBackup media catalog on this server

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

165

■ Media ID is not in the volume configuration
■ Fatal tape manager (bptm) error occurred
■ Total image was not obtained from Phase 1 of import
■ The barcode and media ID do not match in the volume database. One possible

reason for a mismatch is when using tapes previously written by a different
barcode, labels are placed into an ACSLS library using a new barcode label.
Another possible reason is when the administrator attempts to change the media
ID field (usingvmchange) to match the RVSN. When the inventory is updated,
the barcode and media ID are synchronized.

Recommended Action: Check the NetBackup Problems report to find the exact
cause of the failure and try the following:

■

■

■

■

■

If the media ID is already active, duplicate all images on the original media ID
to another volume. Then, manually expire the original media and redo the import.
If the media ID is not present in the volume configuration, add it.
If you received a fatal bptm error, verify that the following are active: the
NetBackup Volume Manager (vmd) on UNIX or the NetBackup Volume Manager
on Windows.
If the entire image is not present, perform import phase 1 on the media IDs that
have the remainder of the image.
If the barcode and media ID are a mismatch, use a barcode label that matches
the recorded media ID. Tapes can then be mounted in a drive with AVRD running
so that the recorded media ID is displayed. Then, a barcode with that label
needs to be placed on the tape.

NetBackup status code: 177

Message: could not deassign media due to Media Manager error
Explanation: The tape manager (bptm) cannot successfully unassign a media ID.
Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ Check the NetBackup Problems report for the cause of the problem.
■ Verify that the NetBackup Volume Manager (vmd) is active on UNIX or the

NetBackup Volume Manager service is active on Windows.

■ For detailed troubleshooting information, create a debug log directory for bptm

and retry the operation. Check the resulting debug log.

Message: Media ID is not in NetBackup volume pool
Explanation: NetBackup tried a backup of its catalogs and the media ID that was
specified for the catalog backup was not in the NetBackup volume pool. Volumes
for catalog backups must be in the NetBackup volume pool.
Recommended Action: Check the Media and Device Management volume
configuration to verify that the media IDs are present and in the NetBackup volume
pool.

NetBackup status code: 191

Message: no images were successfully processed

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

171

Explanation: One of the following has occurred:
■ A verify, duplicate, Auto Image Replication, automatic import, or import was

■

■

tried and failed for all selected images.
If the STS_EFILESYSTEM error code appears (error 2060063) for BasicDisk
or AdvancedDisk, the file system is not configured correctly. The Allocation Unit
Size of the NTFS file system is too small for the BasicDisk or AdvancedDisk
data writes. Or, the maximum fragment size that NetBackup configures is too
large.
If a backup or duplicate job is configured with a retention level greater than 25
and the storage unit specified in the policy is managed by a media server that
runs a version of NetBackup previous to NetBackup 8.0, the backup jobs
associated with the policy fail.

Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ Check the NetBackup Problems report for the cause of the error. To obtain

detailed troubleshooting information, create an admin debug log directory and
retry the operation. Check the resulting debug log.
If the backup or duplicate job failed for a policy configured with a retention level
greater than 25, you can either upgrade the media server to NetBackup 8.0 or
later or set the retention level between 0 and 25. Note that the retention period
for level 25 is always set to expire immediately and this value cannot be changed.
If the error was encountered during duplication of backups, check the duplication
progress log to help determine the root cause of the problem.

■

■

■ An Auto Image Replication job may cause this error. If the storage lifecycle

policy names or data classifications do not match the originating domain and
the target domain, the import job fails. Failed imports appear in the Problems
report when it is run on the target master server. The image is expired and
deleted during catalog cleanup. Note that the originating domain does not track
failed imports.
More information is available about troubleshooting this problem:
For more information on troubleshooting this problem, please see the About
Troubleshooting Auto Image Replication topic of the NetBackup Troubleshooting
Guide.

■ An automatic import job may cause this error. This job is an import job that

shows a storage lifecycle policy name.
More information is available about troubleshooting this problem:
For more information on troubleshooting this problem, please see the About
Troubleshooting Auto Image Replication topic of the NetBackup Troubleshooting
Guide.

If a Vault job encountered the error responsible for the duplication, check the
duplicate.log files in your sidxxx directories to determine the root cause:
UNIX:
/usr/openv/netbackup/vault/sessions/vault_name/sidxxx
Windows:
install_path\NetBackup\vault\sessions\vault_name\sidxxx

(where xxx is the session ID)

■ Reduce the maximum fragment size on the storage unit that writes to this file
system. This value is typically less than 20 GB. But you may need to adjust the
maximum fragment size as necessary until the STS_EFILESYSTEM errors no
longer occur. The value is based on how much data that the storage unit writes
to the image.
To change this value, in the NetBackup Administration Console, in the left
pane, expand NetBackup Management > Storage. Then in the right pane,
double-click the storage unit for this file system. In the Change Storage Unit
dialog box, change the value of the Maximum Fragment Size to 20480 MB (20
GB) by checking the Reduce fragment size to checkbox and entering the new
value.
Increase the Allocation Unit Size by reconfiguring the file system. This usually
requires that you format the file system, so this action may not be a feasible for
an existing file system. Consider this when you create a new file system for
BasicDisk images or AdvancedDisk images. Because setting this value is
different on each OS file system, refer to the appropriate OS or file system
documentation for instructions.

NetBackup status code: 200

Message: scheduler found no backups due to run
Explanation: When the NetBackup scheduler process (nbpem) checked the policy
and the schedule configuration, it did not find any clients to back up.
This error may be due to the following:
■ No backup time windows are open (applies only to full and to incremental

schedules).

■ Policies are set to inactive.
■ The clients were recently backed up and are not due for another backup (based

on Frequency setting for the schedules).

■ Policies do not have any clients.
Recommended Action: Usually, this message can be considered informational
and does not indicate a problem. However, if you suspect a problem, do the
following:
■ Examine the NetBackup All Log Entries report for any messages in addition to

the one that indicates the scheduler found nothing to do.

Recommended Action: For detailed information, review the Vault debug log in
the following directory:
UNIX and Linux: /usr/openv/netbackup/logs/vault
Windows: install_path\NetBackup\logs\vault
Also review the summary.log in each of the sidxxx directories that had problems:
UNIX and Linux: /usr/openv/netbackup/vault/sessions/vault_name/sidxxx
Windows: install_path\NetBackup\vault\sessions\vault_name\sidxxx

After the problem is identified and corrected, the media that were not ejected may
need to be ejected manually by means of vlteject or vltopmenu.
This error often indicates that the media were left in the off-site Vault volume group
but physically reside in the robot or the robotic MAP.
To solve this problem, do one of the following:
■ Manually remove any media that are in the off-site Vault volume group but are

■

still in the robotic library.
Inventory the robotic library. An inventory puts any media that were in the off-site
Vault volume group back into the robotic volume group. Then rerun the Vault
sessions that failed.

NetBackup status code: 508

Message: Cannot write file.
Explanation: This cause of this error is one of the following:
■ The NetBackup Java user service tries to write to a file that does not have write

permissions. The solution is to enable write privileges.

■ The NetBackup Java user service tries to write to a temporary file whose unique
name cannot be constructed. This condition is unlikely, but can result from an
exhaustion of system resources (from the filling of the name space).

Recommended Action: Retrieve the specific details from the user service log
files.
Enable detailed debug logging as explained in the following topic:

NetBackup status code: 509

Message: Cannot execute program.
Explanation: The NetBackup Java authentication or user service reported an error
that relates to the creation (or demise) of a child job process. The NetBackup Java
service programs create separate jobs to accomplish specific tasks, as follows. The
NetBackup Java authentication service creates the NetBackup Java user service.
When it is created and connected to, the NetBackup Java user service creates all
other child processes on behalf of requests from the NetBackup Java interface.
The cause of status code 509 can be found in the appropriate log file, either for
bpjava-msvc, bpjava-susvc, or bpjava-usvc.
The cause can be categorized as one of the following:
■ A job (started by either the NetBackup Java authentication service or user

service) no longer exists and did not report its result status.

■ The NetBackup Java service cannot monitor a job (started by either the

NetBackup Java authentication service or user service). The reason it cannot
monitor is probably due to a lack of system resources (insufficient memory).

■ The maximum number of non-transient Activity Monitor jobs (>100) has already

been started.

Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:

■

■

If the problem persists, restart the NetBackup Java interface and try again.
If the problem still persists, enable detailed debug logging as explained in the
following topic:
See "Setting debug logging to a higher level" in the NetBackup Logging
Reference Guide.

■ Restart the NetBackup Java interface and examine the logs.
The error is probably the result of a system resource issue. When detailed debug
logging is enabled, you can retrieve the details from the bpjava-msvc,
bpjava-susvc, or bpjava-usvc log files.

NetBackup status code: 516

Message: Could not recognize or initialize the requested locale - (locale_NetBackup
Java_was_started_in).
Explanation: This status concerns the UNIX locale configuration (or Windows
regional settings) defined on the host that was specified in the NetBackup Java
logon dialog box. At logon, the locale configuration is passed to the NetBackup
Java authentication service. Status 516 is generated if the locale is not recognized
or if the locale of the user service cannot be initialized.
The rules in the following files determine how a valid locale is recognized:
/usr/openv/msg/.conf on UNIX and install_path\msg\lc.conf on Windows.
When the locale is validated, initialization of the locale in the user service’s
environment is tried (by means of setlocale).
Recommended Action: On the specified host in the NetBackup Java logon dialog
box, check the configuration file to ensure that a mapping is available for the
indicated locale.
For information on locale configuration and mapping, refer to the NetBackup
Administrator's Guide, Volume II.
If there is a mapping, try to set the mapped locale on the host that was specified in
the NetBackup Java logon dialog box. This system may not be configured properly.

Message: unable to start the writer on the media server
Explanation: The bpsynth process was unable to start the following: the bptm or
the bpdm process on the media server that is associated with the target storage unit
to write the synthetic image.
Recommended Action:
Examine the NetBackup error log for any messages that bpsynth logged. For more
information, refer to the following: the debug logs for bpsynth on the master server
and bpcd and bptm or bpdm on the media server. Ensure that the bptm or the bpdm
binaries on the media server are executable and are not corrupt. Try to run the
bptm or the bpdm commands locally on the media server to ensure that the binary
is executable and not corrupt. For instance, you can run the following command:

install_path/netbackup/bin/bptm -count -rn 0 -rt 8

where robot number is 0 and robot type is 8. The robot type that corresponds to
the robot number can be taken from the command line that is logged in the debug
log for bptm. This command displays the counts for the up, shared, and assigned
drives in the robot. In case the synthetic image is to be written to a disk storage
unit, verify the bpdm binary by running the following command:

install_path/netbackup/bin/bpdm

It should print the following:
bpdm: media manager operation not specified

Retry the synthetic backup job. If the problem persists, contact customer support
and send the appropriate logs.

NetBackup status code: 646

Message: unable to get the address of the local listen socket
Explanation: The bpsynth process cannot obtain the address of the opened listen
socket. The bpsynth process needs the address to receive incoming connections
from the bptm or the bpdm processes, which were started to read the source images.
This problem should not happen. The library call used to retrieve the address of
the listen socket relies on the underlying system call to obtain the socket address.
The errno that the system call reports is included in the error message and should
help to diagnose the problem.
Recommended Action: Rerun the synthetic backup job. If the problem persists,

Message: query for list of component images failed
Explanation: A new synthetic image cannot be formed because of a problem with
the required component images. For example: a new, synthetic full backup is tried
from the previous full image from Sunday and from the five differential incremental
images from Monday through Friday. This error occurs if any of those images
(except the most recent image on Friday) have expired.

identifies the reason for the failed resource request.
Recommended Action: Locate the EMM reason string, correct the problem, and
rerun the job.
Some generic EMM reason strings (such as Disk volume is down) may require
generating some reports to determine the cause of the failure. Generate the report
by using either bperror or various log entry reports, such as Reports > Disk
Reports > Disk Logs in the NetBackup Administration Console.

Message: this mpx group is unjoinable
Explanation: This error is a timing problem. It can happen if the job was added to
a multiplexed group when bpbrm terminates due to an error condition. The Resource
Broker (nbrb) does the allocation of a multiplexed group and the Job Manager
(nbjm) starts and monitors the bpbrm process.
Recommended Action: If the failed job is scheduled and the retry count allows
it, nbpem submits the job again. If the failed job was initiated manually, submit it
again.

NetBackup status code: 2000

Message: Unable to allocate new media for backup, storage unit has none
available.
Explanation: The NetBackup Media and Device Selection component (MDS) did
not allocate a new tape volume for backups. The storage unit has no more volumes
available in the volume pool for this backup. NetBackup does not change storage
units during the backup.
Recommended Action: Try the following:
■ Check the NetBackup Problems report to determine the storage unit that is out

of media.
If the storage unit is a robot with empty slots, add more volumes and specify
the correct volume pool. If no empty slots exist, move some media to non-robotic

■

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

337

and add new volumes. If you have difficulty keeping track of your available
volumes, try the available_media script located in the following directory:
On UNIX: /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/goodies/available_media
On Windows: install_path\NetBackup\bin\goodies\available_media.cmd
This script lists all volumes in the volume configuration, and information on the
volumes currently assigned to NetBackup.

■ Set up a scratch volume pool as a reserve of unassigned tapes. If NetBackup
needs a new tape and none are available in the current volume pool, it moves
a tape from the scratch pool into the volume pool that the backup uses.
If the storage unit and volume pool appear to have media, verify the following:
■ Use the NetBackup Media List report to check if the volume is FROZEN or
SUSPENDED. If so, use the bpmedia command to unfreeze it or unsuspend
it, if so desired.

■

■ The volume has not expired or exceeded its maximum number of mounts.
■ The EMM database host name for the device is correct. If you change the

EMM database host name, stop and restart the Media Manager device
daemon (ltid for a UNIX server) or the NetBackup Device Manager service
(Windows server).

■ The correct host is specified for the storage unit in the NetBackup

configuration. The host connection must be the server (master or media)
with drives connected to it.

■ The Media and Device Management volume configuration has media in the
correct volume pool. Unassigned or active media is available at the required
retention level. Use the NetBackup Media List report to show the retention
levels, volume pools, and status for all volumes. Use the NetBackup Media
Summary report to check for active volumes at the correct retention levels.
■ Create the bptm debug log directory, and set the MDS VxUL logging (OID 143)

■

to debug level 2. Then retry the operation.
If this storage unit is new and this attempt to use it is the first, stop and restart
NetBackup on the master server. The MDS unified logging files (OID 143) at
debug level 2 usually show the NetBackup media selection process.

are offline on the media server required for this job.
Recommended Action: Do one of the following:
■ Verify that marked QLogic Target ports exist in the server. The nbftsrvr and
nbfdrv64 processes exit if the system has no ports available for Target Mode
use.

■ Verify that a valid license for the SAN Client feature resides on the master server.

SAN Client is a separately licensed feature that requires a key called "SAN
Client" on the master server. The Fibre Transport server performs a license
check during startup.

■ Determine if a reboot is required for the installation of the Fibre Transport server.

Solaris installations require that you reboot the media server after you install
Fibre Transport to load the Fibre Transport drivers on the marked target ports.
In addition, reboot the Linux servers if you choose to not unload the existing
QLogic drivers during the installation of Fibre Transport.

Explanation: This error can occur when a job uses a disk storage unit whose disk
group resides on a storage server that NetBackup has marked down. This error
can also occur when a cloud storage backup fails.
Recommended Action: Verify that all media servers that are configured for the
storage server can communicate with the storage server. The bpstsinfo command
queries the storage server periodically, so you can use the bpstsinfo log set to
verbosity level 5 on the media server.
If the error is related to a cloud storage backup failure, you should verify the following
information:
■ The cacert.pem file is on both the NetBackup master and the media server in

the following locations:

■ Windows: install_path/var/webtruststore

■ The cacert.pem file is the same on the NetBackup master and the media server.
■ The machine certificate is in the following location:

■ UNIX/Linux: /usr/openv/var/vxss/credentials
■ Windows: install_path/var/vxss/credentials

■ The NetBackup CloudStore Service is active.
■ The Enable insecure communication with 8.0 and earlier hosts option on
the NetBackup master server is selected if the media server is version 8.0 or
earlier. The option is available in the NetBackup Administration Console on
the Security Management > Global Security Settings > Secure
Communication tab.

■

If a virtual CD or DVD ISO is not available on the host where you restore the
virtual machine, the restore fails. The vCenter interface may include the following
message:
Invalid configuration for Device '1'.

If the virtual machine to restore and the virtual machine that contains the hotadd
restore host do not reside in the same data center, the restore fails.

■ The restore host cannot access the VMware datastore over the selected transport
mode. The job log on the restore host may contain messages like the following
example:
FTL - Virtual machine restore: VxMS initialization failed.

■ You attempted to restore a file that has a path name longer than 1023 characters.
A backup of a Linux virtual machine backs up all files, including those with path
names longer than 1023 characters. But you cannot restore the long path-name
files individually.

■ For the restore, the virtual machine's hardware version (such as 7) is later than
the hardware version that the target server supports. If VMware Tools cannot
convert the virtual machine's hardware version to an earlier version, the restore
fails. Messages similar to the following appear in the detailed status log:
Info bpVMutil(pid=6268) INF - vmwareLogger: WaitForTaskCompleteEx:
The virtual machine version is not compatible with the version of the
host <hostname>.

■ You attempted to restore a large virtual machine with one or more VMDKs that

are formatted as Thick Provision Eager Zeroed. Because of the size of the
virtual machine or its VMDKs, creation of the virtual machine may take more
than 2 hours. As a result, the restore failed.

Recommended Action: Check the job details in the Activity Monitor and take
action as dictated by that information, as follows:
■ Ensure that an .ISO file that is presented to a virtual machine as a virtual CD or

DVD during backup is available on the destination host.

■ For a successful hotadd restore, ensure that the two virtual machines are in the

same VMware data center.

■ Select a different transport mode and retry the restore.
■ You cannot restore restore a file that has a path name longer than 1023

characters.

NetBackup status code: 4287

Message: A NetBackup snapshot of the virtual machine exists and the policy option
specifies aborting the backup
Explanation: One or more NetBackup created snapshots exist on the virtual
machine and the Existing snapshot handling option in the policy specifies aborting
the backup. The snapshots that NetBackup creates start with the NBU_SNAPSHOT
or NBU_RESTORE strings in the snapshot name.
Possible causes of an existing NetBackup snapshot are the following:
■ A snapshot from a previous backup has not been deleted (an orphaned

snapshot). NetBackup should have deleted the snapshot when the backup
completed.

■ Two policies try to back up the virtual machine at the same time. The backup

for one of the policies detects the snapshot that the other policy created.

Recommended Action: Do the following, as appropriate:
■ Manually remove the orphaned snapshot.

For VMware, you can use the VMware vSphere interface to remove virtual
machine snapshots. For Hyper-V, you can use nbhypervtool.exe to remove
NetBackup snapshots that were created with the WMI backup method. For more
information on nbhypervtool.exe, refer to the NetBackup Commands Reference
Guide.

■ Reduce the likelihood of orphaned snapshots by changing the resource limits

to reduce the load on the appropriate VMware or Hyper-V resource. The
Resource Limit dialog is in the NetBackup Administration Console under
Host Properties > Master Servers. The NetBackup guides for VMware and
Hyper-V describe the available settings.

■ Change the NetBackup policy schedules to avoid simultaneous backups of the

virtual machine.

■ For VMware only: Change the NetBackup policy's Existing snapshot handling

parameter to a different option (such as Continue Backup).

NetBackup status code: 5903

Message: CA certificate could not be verified.
Explanation: The CA certificate that is on the host cannot be used to perform the
request. Trust is not established with the NetBackup host to which you are trying
to communicate. The CA certificate is not in the trust store in the host certificate
database or the trust store has more than one certificate with the same name
(usually, a generic name like localhost.localdomain). The web service certificate
may also have expired.
Recommended Action: The NetBackup host must trust the CA. Check if the CA
certificate was added to the trust store with the nbcertcmd –listCACertDetails
command. Run the nbcertcmd –getCACertificate command to add the certificate
to the trust store.
If the trust store has multiple certificates with the same (generic) name, contact

NetBackup status code: 5987

Message: Cannot fetch the host ID of the NetBackup master server. The master
server does not have the certificate.
Explanation: The master server does not have the certificate or the NetBackup
Service Layer (NBSL) on the master server is down.
Recommended Action: Ensure that the following occurs:
■ NBSL is running on the master server

■

■

If NBSL is running on the master server, ensure that the host ID-based certificate
is deployed on the master server
If the host ID-based certificate is deployed and if you still see this error, refer to
the Resolving the master server host name change issue procedure..
Resolving the master server host name change issue
This error may occur if the master server host name is changed from a Fully Qualified
Domain Name (FQDN) to a short name (or vice versa) in any of the following
scenarios:
■ NetBackup installation after a disaster

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

486

■ Manual update in the NetBackup configuration file (bp.conf file on the UNIX or

Windows registry).

In the following example, NetBackup is installed on a master server with a short
name and the catalog backup is run. After a disaster, NetBackup is installed on the
master server in a disaster recovery mode, but this time with FQDN. However, the
identity of the master server (or disaster recovery package) is restored with the
short name. This can cause failure when reissuing the client certificates,
automatically renewing the client certificates and deploying new certificates on
clients.
To resolve this issue, use the following steps:
1.
2. Run following command:

Log on to the master server.

UNIX:
/usr/openv/netbackup/bin/nbcertcmd -ping
Windows:
Install_path\NetBackup\bin\nbcertcmd -ping

■

■

If the command is executed successfully, proceed to next step.
If it fails with the exist status code 8509 (The specified server name was
not found in the web service certificate), then carry out the steps that are
provided in the following technote:
https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.000126751
Proceed to the next step.

3. Stop and start the NetBackup Web Management Console service on the master

server. Use following the NetBackup command:
UNIX:
/usr/openv/netbackup/bin/nbwmc -terminate
/usr/openv/netbackup/bin/nbwmc -start
Windows:
install_path\NetBackup\wmc\bin\nbwmc.exe -stop -srvname "NetBackup
Web Management Console"
install_path\NetBackup\wmc\bin\nbwmc.exe -start -srvname
"NetBackup Web Management Console"

4. Perform the user login on the master server. Use the following command:

install_path/netbackup/bin/bpnbat -login -loginType WEB

NetBackup status codes
NetBackup status codes

487

For example:
install_path\netbackup\bin\bpnbat -login -loginType WEB

Authentication Broker [abc.example.com is default]:
Authentication port [0 is default]:
Authentication type (NIS, NISPLUS, WINDOWS, vx, unixpwd,
ldap)[WINDOWS is default]:
Domain [abc.example.com is default]:
Login Name [administrator is default]:
Password:
Operation completed successfully.

5. Note the value of the key Client_Name for the master server. For a clustered
master server, note the value of the key Cluster_Name This can be found at
the following locations:
UNIX:/usr/openv/netbackup/bp.conf
Windows:HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Veritas\NetBackup\CurrentVersion\Config
This value can either be the FQDN or the short name. For example,
abc.example.com.

6. Note the host ID of the master server. You can obtain its value by using the

following command:
install_path/netbackup/bin/nbcertcmd -listCertDetails
For a clustered master setup, use the following command:
install_path\netbackup\bin\nbcertcmd -listCertDetails -cluster
This command may return multiple records (if only one record is returned,
select the host ID provided in that record).

■

■

If the host name obtained in step 5 is FQDN, then pick the record where
the “Issued By” entry matches its short name.
If the host name obtained in step 5 is a short name, then pick the record
where the “Issued By” entry matches its FQDN.

For example:
install_path\netbackup\bin\nbcertcmd -listCertDetails

Master Server : abc
Host ID : xxxxxx-4201-4c6a-xxxx-xxxxx
Issued By : /CN=broker/OU=root@abc/O=vx

Operation completed successfully.

Here, 2 records are returned. For the first record, the issuer name provided in
the “Issued By” field matches the short name of the client_name obtained in
step 5. Select the host ID that appears in the first record.

7. Add a host ID-to-host name mapping. Map the host ID of the master server
that you have obtained in step 6 to the host name that you have obtained in
step 5.
Use the following command:
install_path/netbackup/bin/admincmd/nbhostmgmt -a -i host_ID -hm
host_name

For example:
install_path/netbackup/bin/admincmd/nbhostmgmt -a -i

xxxxxx-4201-4c6a-xxxx-xxxxx -hm abc.example.com

abc.example.com is successfully mapped to xxxxxx-4201-4c6a-xxxx-xxxxx.

You can also add this host ID-to-host name mapping using the NetBackup
Administration Console. Use the Security Management > Host Management
> Hosts tab.

8. Renew the host ID-based certificate of the master server by using the following

command:
install_path/netbackup/bin/nbcertcmd -renewCertificate
For a clustered master server, use the following command:
install_path\netbackup\bin\nbcertcmd -renewCertificate -cluster

NetBackup status code: 5989

Message: The reissue token is mandatory as a certificate was already issued to
this host. Revoke the existing certificate if it is active and map this host name to
the associated host ID.
Explanation: The host names that are used during the installation and re-installation
are different; however, the host names are associated with same host ID. This can
happen if the host name used earlier is a shortname and the one used now is in
FQDN or vice versa. You need to identify the host record in the NetBackup
Administration Console, using the Security Management > Host Management
> Hosts tab or the nbhostmgmt command and use the host ID to generate the
reissue token. You can also ensure that the client name of the host matches the
one in the above listing.
Recommended Action: To deploy a certificate using this new name, you need to
provide a reissue token for the existing host ID. For successful re-installation using
the new host name, ensure the following:
■ The certificate is revoked if it is active.
■ The host names are mapped to the associated host ID. In the NetBackup

Administration Console, use the Security Management > Host Management
> Hosts tab or the nbhostmgmt command to add mappings.

■ Ensure that the client name for the host matches the primary host name

associated with the issued host ID.

NetBackup status code: 8621

Message: The connection is dropped because the host appears to be NetBackup
8.0 or earlier.
Explanation: The earlier communication status shows that the peer host could
communicate securely, but it seems to have been downgraded to NetBackup 8.0
or earlier, and, therefore, the connection is not established.
Recommended Action: Verify that the peer host was upgraded and then
downgraded to a back-level release. If this is the case, then the NetBackup
administrator can mark the given host as insecure.
If this is not the case, then another host is trying to spoof the peer host. You can
use the network tools to find out which host it is and take corrective action.

NetBackup status code: 8622

Message: The connection is dropped because a conflict in the host ID-to-host
name mapping is detected.
Explanation: The host ID of the peer host does not match the host ID that is known
to the master server and, therefore, the connection is not established. This error
can occur in one of the following scenarios:

■

In a cluster setup, the active node is down and an inactive node becomes active.
Mapping between the host ID of the new active node and the virtual name is
not present.

■ Two or more hosts in a given NetBackup domain have the same host name.
■ An unknown host tries to spoof as the peer host.
Recommended Action: If there are multiple host IDs in your environment that are
associated with the same host name, the NetBackup administrator should verify
and approve the mapping.
If an unknown host tries to spoof the peer host, you can use the available network
tools to find out which host it is and take corrective action.

type for the robot number that is associated with the request.

Media Manager status code 55

Message: robot number and volume group mismatch
Explanation: A request was made to add or change the volumes in the volume
configuration. The robot number and the volume group that is associated with the
volume configuration changes are in conflict with the requirements for volume

Media Manager status codes
Media Manager status codes

570

groups. All of the volumes in a volume group are required to have the same
residence and that includes having the same robot number.
Recommended Action:
■ Examine the command output, debug logs, and system logs for a more detailed

message on the error.
See "Setting Media Manager debug logging to a higher level" in the NetBackup
Logging Reference Guide.

■ Ensure that the specified robot number and volume group are compatible. If the
volumes in the volume group have a given robot number, then the volumes with
a different robot number cannot be added to that volume group. The volumes
cannot be moved directly from one robotic volume group to another robotic
volume group. The intermediate steps (some volume entries are changed and
some are not) would cause a conflict with the robot numbers. Choose a different
volume group on the request, or let the volume group be selected automatically.
The volume group selection depends on the specific interface being used.

Media Manager status code 57

Message: error auto-generating volume group
Explanation: A request was made to add or change the volumes in the volume
configuration by using automatic generation of the volume group name. A unique
volume group name cannot be generated because all of the available combinations
have already been used.
Recommended Action: Consolidate the volumes into volume groups within the
targeted robot number so that a new volume group can be generated automatically
or provide a specific volume group name.

Media Manager status code 58

Message: daemon cannot obtain socket
Explanation: vmd cannot bind to its socket. (vmd is the NetBackup Volume Manager
daemon on UNIX and Linux and the NetBackup Volume Manager service on
Windows.) When vmd attempts to bind to its configured port number, the system
call fails. The call fails usually because another process acquired the port before
the vmd daemon or service started.
Recommended Action:
■ Examine the daemon debug log for a more detailed message on the system

error.

■

If another process has the port, use other system commands to determine the
process. Based on the result, either change the port number in your services
file or map, or terminate the process that has acquired the port.

■ UNIX and Linux only: Another possible cause for this error is the use of the kill

command to terminate vmd. To stop vmd, the recommended method is to use
the command-line request, vmctrldbm -t. The use of the kill command to
stop this process can leave it unable to bind to its assigned port the next time
it restarts. When the socket problem occurs, the daemon debug log contains
lines similar to the following:
unable to obtain bound socket, Address already in use (125)

Media Manager status code 68

Message: too many volumes in volume group
Explanation: A request was made to add or change the volumes in the volume
configuration, but the volume number was at its allowable limit. The limit is based
on the number of volumes that are allowed in a particular type of robot.
Recommended Action:
■ Examine the command output, debug logs, and system logs for a more detailed

message on the error.
See "Setting Media Manager debug logging to a higher level" in the NetBackup
Logging Reference Guide.

■ Check to see if the volumes are defined in the EMM database. They may be
defined in the EMM database that is associated with a slot number zero that
may not exist in the robot. Run a robot inventory. Show the contents of the robot
report and observe the starting slot number. If the starting slot number is one
and a volume is defined in the robot at slot zero, delete the volume entry or
move it to a standalone so that the remaining available media slots can be used.

Media Manager status code 69

Message: failed sending request to vmd
Explanation: A request cannot be sent to vmd or to oprd, even though the initial
connection to the server process was successful. (vmd is the NetBackup Volume
Manager daemon on UNIX and Linux or NetBackup Volume Manager service on
Windows; oprd is the operator request daemon or process.)
Recommended Action:
■ Examine the command output, debug logs, and system logs for a more detailed

message on the error.
See "Setting Media Manager debug logging to a higher level" in the NetBackup
Logging Reference Guide.

■ Check to see whether the vmd or the oprd process continues to run once it

receives the connection from the requestor. Run netstat -a or an equivalent

Media Manager status codes

socket diagnostic utility. Check the following to see if the server process is hung
up:
■ Daemon debug log on the server-side system
■ Process status of vmd or oprd

Media Manager status code 70

Message: cannot connect to vmd [on host host name]
Explanation: A process times out while connecting to either vmd (the NetBackup
Volume Manager daemon on UNIX and Linux or NetBackup Volume Manager
service on Windows) or to oprd (the operator request daemon or process). This
problem can occur when a connection is attempted and the server process is not
running. It also can occur if the network or server is heavily loaded and has a slow
response time.
Recommended Action:
■ On the host where vmd is the recipient of the connection, verify that the daemon
or the service is running. (The host is the Media Manager host, the Device Host,
or the EMM server.) If the daemon or the service is not running, start it. On
Windows, vmd is the NetBackup Volume Manager service.
If vmd is already running, examine the command output, debug logs, and system
logs for a more detailed message on the error.
See "Setting Media Manager debug logging to a higher level" in the NetBackup
Logging Reference Guide.

■

■ Verify that the correct host names are defined in the configuration.
■ Check the services file. On UNIX and Linux, verify that the /etc/services file
(and NIS services if NIS is used) has entries for the vmd service. (Note that the
vmd service always starts oprd.) On Windows, verify that the
%systemroot%\system32\drivers\etc\services file has the correct entry for
vmd. Also verify that the vmd port number in the services file agrees with the port
number configuration. The port number is noted in the man page for vmd(1M).
■ Verify that all of the operating system patches or service packs are installed.
■ Ensure that the Media Manager configuration is not tuned so that the load on
vmd exceeds its ability to service requests. Look for entries in the vm.conf file
that increase the load. Consider placing the EMM database on a higher
performance server and file system if performance is an issue. To reduce the
number of volumes in the volume configuration, use inventory filtering for the
robot types that support it

tpconfig -d command to list the configured EMM server. Select the current
server (the one being administered) to be the same as the host, which is the
correct EMM server. Perform the following so the volume residence query can
find a matching volume: update the volume or the device configurations, modify
the volume properties, or adjust the search criteria as needed.

Media Manager status code 80

Message: cannot update database due to existing errors
Explanation: The vmphyinv command is unable to update the EMM database
because of the existing errors. The errors can be as follows:
■ A Media Manager volume record belongs to a different robot with the same

media ID as the media ID that was read by the tape header.

■ The media type, the media GUID, or the volume pool of an assigned volume

record needs to be changed.

■ A barcode conflict is detected and vmphyinv needs to change the barcode of

the existing volume record.

Recommended Action: The vmphyinv command generates a list of errors.
Examine the output and resolve all of these errors before you run the utility again.

Media Manager status code 81

Message: robot type and volume group mismatch
Explanation: A request was made to add volumes or change volume residences
in the volume configuration. The robot type and volume group that is associated
with the volume configuration changes are in conflict with the requirements for
volume groups. All volumes in a volume group are required to have the same

Media Manager status codes
Media Manager status codes

580

residence, which includes having the same robot type. A requested operation may
have tried to associate the special No Volume Group name "---" with a robotic
residence.
Recommended Action:
■ Examine the command output, debug logs, and system logs for a more detailed

message on the error.
See "Setting Media Manager debug logging to a higher level" in the NetBackup
Logging Reference Guide.

■ Ensure that the specified robot residence and the volume group are compatible
with other volumes in the volume configuration that are in the specified volume
group. Do not move volumes in the special No Volume Group name to a robotic
residence without moving them to a new or auto-generated volume group.
Choose a different volume group on the request, or let the volume group be
automatically selected. The volume group selection depends on the specific
interface being used.

Media Manager status code 82

Message: robot host and volume group mismatch
Explanation: A request was made to add volumes or change volume residences
in the volume configuration. The robot host and volume group that is associated
with the volume configuration changes are in conflict with the requirements for
volume groups. All volumes in a volume group are required to have the same
residence. This residence includes having the same robot host, where robot host
equivalence is defined as having the same case-sensitive robot host string.
Recommended Action:
■ Examine the command output, debug logs, and system logs for a more detailed

message on the error.
See "Setting Media Manager debug logging to a higher level" in the NetBackup
Logging Reference Guide.

■ Ensure that the specified robot residence and volume group are compatible with
other volumes in the volume configuration that are in the specified volume group.
Do not try to add volumes for a robot host by using a different form of the robot
host name. For example, acme is not the same as acme.veritas.com. Use the
same host name that is used for other volumes in the volume group. If the robot
host needs to be changed for volumes in a volume group, do the following: use
a single move volume group request (available only in certain media management
interfaces) to move the volume group to a standalone residence. Then, move
the volume group back to the robotic residence. Specify the robot control host
that you want to be associated with the new volume group.

vmd.

Media Manager status code 90

Message: invalid volume pool
Explanation: A request was made to add volumes, change the volume pool for a
volume, add a barcode rule, or change a barcode rule. However, the volume pool
name or number that is associated with the requested change is in conflict with the
requirements for volume pools.
These requirements are as follows:
■ Volumes in scratch pools cannot be assigned until they are first moved to another

pool.

■ Volume pool numbers cannot be negative.
■ Volume pool names must consist of from 1 to 20 printable ASCII characters with

no embedded whitespace.

■ The None volume pool is the only valid pool for the barcode rule entries that

specify cleaning a media type.

Recommended Action:
■ Examine the command output, debug logs, and system logs for a more detailed

message on the error.
See "Setting Media Manager debug logging to a higher level" in the NetBackup
Logging Reference Guide.

■ Ensure that the specified volume pool does not violate the requirements noted.

for NetBackup). Then retry the delete volume request.

Media Manager status code 93

Message: volume is already assigned
Explanation: A request was made to assign a volume and the volume was already
assigned.
Recommended Action:
■ Examine the command output, debug logs, and system logs for a more detailed

message on the error.
See "Setting Media Manager debug logging to a higher level" in the NetBackup
Logging Reference Guide.

■ Do not try to manually assign any volumes that are already assigned, because
it is not valid except for one condition: you can assign volumes for NetBackup
catalog backups if the volume is already assigned for NetBackup catalog
backups. Always use barcodes that are unique in the six least significant
characters across all media in all of the robots, or use media ID generation rules
to ensure that unique media IDs are generated in a robot inventory update.

Media Manager status code 94

Message: volume is not in specified pool
Explanation: A request was made to assign a volume from a specified volume
pool. The volume was in a different volume pool.

■ When you use the robot inventory update to make changes to the volume

configuration, do the following: ensure that all of the volumes of the same physical
cartridge type (for example, 3590J in TLH robots) map to a single media type,
such as HCART. This check ensures that all of the media in the robotic library
can be mounted on drives with a compatible drive type.

■ When you assign the volumes manually, specify the media type that is associated

with the volume. Always use barcodes that are unique with respect to the six
least significant characters, across all of the media in all of the robots. You can
also use media ID generation rules to ensure that the unique media IDs are
generated when you use the robot inventory update.

Media Manager status code 96

■ Correct the vmd security configuration by modifying the authentication

configuration.

Note: Ensure that both the source and the destination machines are within a
single NBU domain.

■

If an authentication problem (rather than a configuration issue) is suspected, do
the following:
■ Check the methods_allow.txt files on the systems that have problems to
ensure that authentication is enabled. The files are in the following locations:
On Windows: install_path\NetBackup\var\auth
On UNIX and Linux: /usr/openv/var/auth

■ On the systems that have the authentication problem, remove the remote

host that is not authenticated from the methods_allow.txt file.
For example, if Host A and Host B have the problem, remove Host A from
the file on Host B, and vice versa.
Retry the operation. If the problem still exists, the connection problems are
not related to authentication.

■ Add back the removed hosts and retry the operation.

Media Manager status code 127

Message: unable to generate a unique media ID
Explanation: A request was made to add volumes in the volume configuration by
using the robot inventory update or by using a media ID seed. A unique media ID
was not generated because the "use seed" option was not specified, or because
the available media ID combinations were used up.
Recommended Action: If you use robot inventory update, either ensure that all
of the media in the robotic library have readable barcode labels, or request updates
by using a seed to generate media IDs for non-barcoded media automatically. If
the volumes are added by specifying a seed, use a seed that allows media ID
character combinations beyond those already in use. To identify the slot that is
associated with the media that may not have a readable barcode, examine the
command output.

■ Verify that the correct version of software is running on all of the servers.

Media Manager status code 130

Message: requested drive is already reserved
Explanation: A request was made to reserve a shared drive with the EMM/DA,
but the drive was already reserved for another host.
This error is a normal occurrence when the drive resources are oversubscribed for
either of the following reasons:

Independent schedulers or applications access the same pool of drives

■
■ Hardware or media errors cause some drives that are allocated to jobs to become

unavailable.

■

Recommended Action:
■ Check the system log and the application (bptm) debug log to determine if
hardware or media errors have caused the drives to become unavailable.
If more information is needed on the drive reservation problem, examine the
command output, debug logs, and system logs for a more detailed message on
the error.
See "Setting Media Manager debug logging to a higher level" in the NetBackup
Logging Reference Guide.

Media Manager status code 131

other drives.

Media Manager status codes
Media Manager status codes

596

This abnormal condition can occur when two different hosts with the same name
registered different drive lists with the EMM server and one of those hosts requested
a drive reservation. (The same host name occurs when the SSO_HOST_NAME entries
in the vm.conf file override the local host name.)
Recommended Action: Use unique (non-duplicate) strings for host names and
the SSO_HOST_NAME configuration file entries.

Media Manager status code 132

Message: requested drive is not currently registered
Explanation: A request was made to reserve or release a shared drive with the
EMM server. The requesting host or any other host has not registered the drive.
Recommended Action: This condition is abnormal. It can occur when the EMM
server was stopped and restarted. This situation is automatically handled because
the requesting host re-registers its drives with the EMM server when this error is
encountered.

Media Manager status code 133

Message: requested drive is not reserved by host
Explanation: A request was made to release a shared drive with the EMM server.
The requesting host did not reserve the drive, although it was reserved for another
host.
This condition is abnormal. It can occur if a network problem or a suspended process
exists, as in the following examples:
■ Host A reserves a shared drive.
■ Host A becomes unavailable for some time and is unable to communicate with

other hosts.

■ Host B determines that the host having the reservation (Host A) is no longer
available. Host B then makes a request to the EMM/DA denoting Host A as
unavailable.

■ Another host (such as Host A or Host C) reserves the drive.
■ The host that originally owned the drive reservation tries to release the drive.
Recommended Action: Correct the network or the process problem that led to
the communications problem. Ensure that unique non-duplicate strings are used
for host names and for the SSO_HOST_NAME configuration file entries.

process exists, as in the following examples:
■ Host A reserves a shared drive.
■ Host A becomes unavailable for some time and is unable to communicate with

other hosts.

■ Host B determines that the host having the reservation (Host A) is no longer
available. Host B then makes a request to the EMM/DA denoting Host A as
unavailable.

■ The host that originally owned the drive reservation tries to release the drive.
Recommended Action: Correct the network or the process problem that led to
the communications problem. Ensure that unique non-duplicate strings are used
for host names and for the SSO_HOST_NAME configuration file entries.

Media Manager status code 135

Message: requested host is not currently registered
Explanation: A request was made to the EMM/DA to reserve or release a shared
drive or designate a host as unavailable. The host (that reserved or released the
drive or that was designated as unavailable) was not registered with the EMM/DA.
This condition is abnormal and can occur in the following situations:
■ The EMM server was stopped and restarted. This situation is automatically

handled, because the requesting host re-registers its drives with the EMM server
when this error is encountered.

■ A host was unregistered with the EMM server and another host declared the

host to be unavailable.

Recommended Action: If the host was declared as unavailable, determine whether
it should be available. Correct the underlying network problems or restart ltid (the
device daemon on UNIX and Linux or NetBackup Device Manager service on
Windows).

date in the format specified by the Media Management interface documentation.

Media Manager status code 145

Message: requested drive is already reserved by host
Explanation: A request was made to the EMM/DA to reserve a shared drive. The
drive was already reserved for the requesting host.
This condition is abnormal. It can occur if two different hosts with the same name
registered the same drive name with the EMM/DA. (The same host name occurs
when the SSO_HOST_NAME entries in the vm.conf file override the local host name.)
In this case, one of those hosts has a drive reservation and the other host tries to
reserve the same drive.
Recommended Action: Use unique non-duplicate strings for host names and for
the SSO_HOST_NAME configuration file entries.

Media Manager status code 146

Message: incompatible database version
Explanation: A requesting process or vmd encountered an invalid or an unknown
database or communications protocol. The possible datastores that an error affects

Message: invalid scratch pool name
Explanation: You or a NetBackup media management interface have tried to
specify the NetBackup, DataStore, or None pool as a scratch pool. The NetBackup,
DataStore, and None pools cannot be specified as scratch pools.
Recommended Action: Create a scratch pool with a different name.

Media Manager status code 175

Message: unable to open the device test state file
Explanation: The process is not able to open the state file, mostly likely because
another process locked it.
Recommended Action: Try again to open the state file. If you cannot open the
state file, you may have to remove the file, which will result in a loss of the previous
test runs.

Media Manager status code 176

Message: unable to find any records in the device test database
Explanation: The state file exists, but it is empty. This error indicates that no
previous test runs have occurred.
Recommended Action: None required.

Media Manager status code 177

Message: request can only be performed on the Media and Device Management
Domain Server
Explanation: The host that this request was performed on is blocked from being
a database host. An administrator blocked the host to restrict which hosts are
allowed to be EMM servers.
Recommended Action:
■ Verify that you specified the correct EMM server (the -h option on the command
line). If you did not specify the database host, the command line defaults to the
local host, while the console uses the currently administered host.

■ Contact the administrator in charge of this configuration and verify that the host

was intentionally blocked from being a database host. If not, remove the
NOT_DATABASE_HOST flag in the host’s vm.conf file. To do this without having to
stop and restart the daemons, use the following command:

Media Manager status codes

608

vmquery -h <hostname> -remove_not_db_host.
To add this entry to a host without having to stop and restart the daemons, use
the following command: vmquery -h <hostname> -add_not_db_host.

Media Manager status code 181

Message: not authorized to connect to robotic daemon
Explanation: A caller requesting services from a robotic daemon is not
authenticated or authorized, or a problem occurs when two systems try to
authenticate one another.
Recommended Action:
■ See the NetBackup Security and Encryption Guide for information on Media

Manager security.
Media Manager security is based on NetBackup authentication or authorization
and the media server entries defined in bp.conf/Host Properties on the
master server for the specific NBU domain.

■ Examine the debug log files for a more detailed message on the authentication

and authorization problem.
See "Setting Media Manager debug logging to a higher level" in the NetBackup
Logging Reference Guide.

■ Determine whether the authorization fails on vmd. Examine the debug log files
for Media Manager status code 126 occurrences (not authorized to connect to
vmd).

■ Correct the Media Manager security configuration by modifying the authentication

configuration and the ENABLE_ROBOT_AUTH entry.

Note: Ensure that both the source and the destination machines are within a
single NBU domain.

■

If an authentication problem (rather than a configuration issue) is suspected, do
the following:
■ Check the methods_allow.txt files on the systems that have problems to
ensure that authentication is enabled. The files are in the following locations:
On Windows: install_path\NetBackup\var\auth
On UNIX and Linux: /usr/openv/var/auth

■ On the systems that have the authentication problem, remove the remote
host that is not authenticated from the methods_allow.txt file and retry the
operation.

Media Manager status codes
Media Manager status codes

609

For example, if Host A and Host B have the problem, remove Host A from
the file on Host B, and vice versa.
If the problem still exists, the error is caused by connection problems that
are not related to the authentication.
Add the removed names and retry the operation.

Media Manager status code 182

Message: device test state file does not exist
Explanation: The state file does not exist. The reason may be because no tests
have been run yet.
Recommended Action: If the state file is lost, any previous test runs are also lost.
The recommended action is to start again.

Media Manager status code 185

Message: the robotic library is full and may still have media in its map
Explanation: During a robot inventory update, the user attempted to use the
empty_map option. The MAP contained more media than the space allowed in the
library. In this case, the inventory update was successful, but the empty_map part
was only partially successful. Those media that are still in the MAP are not changed
or added in the EMM database.
Recommended Action: No action is necessary on the user’s part except to be
aware that not all of the media was removed from the MAP and placed into the
library.

Media Manager status code 186

Message: invalid container ID
Explanation: A NetBackup Vault container ID was used with an invalid character.
Recommended Action:
■ Examine the command output, debug logs, and system logs for a more detailed

message on the error.
See "Setting Media Manager debug logging to a higher level" in the NetBackup
Logging Reference Guide.

■ Retry the operation with a container ID that does not contain invalid characters.

Message: VxSS authentication failed
Explanation: The parties on either end of a socket connection cannot mutually
authenticate each other.
Recommended Action:
■ Ensure that the Veritas Product Authentication Service is installed and configured.
For complete installation instructions, see the NetBackup Security and Encryption
Guide.

■ Check that both parties have a valid certificate by examining the listed expiry

date from the bpnbat -WhoAmI command. For example:
bpnbat -WhoAmI
Name: JDOG
Domain: MYCOMPANY
Issued by: /CN=broker/OU=root@machine1.mycompany.com/O=vx
Expiry Date: Sep 19 12:51:55 2009 GMT
Authentication method: Microsoft Windows
Operation completed successfully.

■ Shows an expiry date of September 19th, 2009. After 12:51:55 GMT, this

■

credential is no longer valid and a new credential is required.
If you run from the NetBackup Administration Console, close and reopen the
console. The console automatically obtains a credential for the currently logged
in identity, if possible. By default, these certificates are valid for 24 hours. The
following is an example of how to extend the credential beyond 24 hours to 30
days (2592000 seconds):

■ # vssat setexpiryintervals -p <plugin_name> -t <user> -e 2592000
■ Ensure that the certificates for both sides either use the same broker, are children

of the same root broker, or have trusts established between them.
More information is available on broker hierarchies and how to establish trust
relationships between brokers.
See the NetBackup Security and Encryption Guide.

■ Ensure that connectivity is possible between the physical systems in question.

If general sockets cannot connect between the machines (such as ping and
telnet), network issues unrelated to NetBackup may be the cause of this
problem.

■ Ensure that the system has sufficient swap space and that the following

directories are not full:

Media Manager status codes
Media Manager status codes

611

■ /home/username
■ /usr/openv/netbackup/logs
■ /tmp

Media Manager status code 188

Message: VxSS Access Denied
Explanation: The user identity that is used to attempt an operation does not have
the permissions needed to perform the action.
Recommended Action:

■

If you use the default groups, make certain that the user attempts to perform an
operation appropriate for that group. For example, a member of NBU_Operators
is unable to modify policy information because it is a permission that is reserved
for administrator roles.

■ Ensure that the system has sufficient swap space and that the following

directories are not full:
■ /home/username
■ /usr/openv/netbackup/logs
■ /tmp

■

If you use your own defined groups and permissions, first determine the object
with which the operation is associated. Then, add the permissions relative to
the action. For example, a user is required to up and down drives but does not
currently have permission to do so. Verify that the user belongs to the correct
authorization group.
If necessary, verify that the group has Up and Down permissions on the Drive
object within the Group Permission tab. If necessary, you can increase the
verbosity level of NetBackup to locate what object and what permissions are
required for the failing request. The pertinent lines in the debug logs look similar
to the following:

for details.

Device configuration status codes
Device configuration status codes

628

Explanation: Device discovery cannot obtain or verify its lock file or had a problem
with the EMM server.
Recommended Action:
■ Examine the daemon debug log and command or interface output for a more

detailed message on the system error.
See "Setting Media Manager debug logging to a higher level" in the NetBackup
Logging Reference Guide.

■ Retry the operation and examine the logs. One of the following may have

occurred:
■ Lock file problems: The device discovery process sets a lockfile in the

/usr/openv/volmgr/misc (UNIX and Linux) or install_path\Volmgr\misc
(Windows) directory named tpac.lock. It sets the lockfile to ensure that
only one instance of discovery runs on a particular host. It then checks the
lockfile before it updates the configuration.
■ Cannot obtain lockfile.

The lockfile may be held by another discovery process. In this case, the
following error is displayed:

another tpautoconf is already running

Use standard OS process tools (ps on UNIX and Linux or Task Manager
on Windows) to determine if another tpautoconf process is running. If
not, delete the lockfile and re-run device discovery. If another tpautoconf
process is running, wait for it to complete before retrying.

■ Failed the lockfile check.

In the case of long device-discovery cycles, the interface may timeout or
the user may cancel the process. Part of the timeout or cancelation is to
remove the lockfile. This action tells the device discovery process that it
should not continue making modifications to the device configuration. If
action occurs, run the discovery process again.

Device configuration status code 48
Message: RSM is not supported.

651

Windows.) ltid is probably not running. If ltid is still running, its process lock file
may have been removed. Also, message queues may not function correctly on the
system.
Recommended Action:

■

■

If ltid is not running, start ltid and try the operation again. On UNIX and Linux,
run /usr/openv/volmgr/bin/ltid, and on Windows, start the NetBackup
Device Manager service.
If ltid is already running, check for the existence and permissions of the lock
file itself and the lock file directory, that are as follows:
/usr/openv/volmgr/misc/.ltipid (UNIX and Linux) or install_path\
Volmgr\misc\.ltipid (Windows). Terminate the ltid process if it is running.
Create the lock directory or folder and adjust the permissions as needed so that
ltid can obtain the lock.

■ On UNIX and Linux, check the msgget man page and look for suggestions on

how to troubleshoot the system message queues.

Device management status code 23
Message: Invalid Drive Number
Explanation: A request was made for drive, but no such drive can be found in the
active configuration.
Recommended Action: Ensure that ltid was stopped and restarted after changes
were last made to the device configuration. (ltid is the Media Manager device
daemon on UNIX and Linux or the NetBackup Device Manager service on Windows.)
Display the device configuration (by using tpconfig -d or other means) to view
the list of valid drives. Specify the drive name or index as appropriate for the interface
being used.

Device management status code 24

Message: Requested drive cannot be reserved
Explanation: An attempt was made to reserve a shared drive, but the drive
reservation request failed. This status code is related to the internal implementation
of the SSO feature. It is not related to SCSI Reserve or Release.
Recommended Action: This condition is expected for any shared drives that are
retried automatically. If problems persist, verify that the EMM server services
requests and it does not list drives as reserved to hosts that currently do not use
the drives.

Device management status codes
Device management status codes

652

Device management status code 25

Message: File name does not exist
Explanation: A logical tape file or help file cannot be found. The tpunmount
command was probably issued with a logical tape file specified that does not exist
for this user.
Recommended Action: Check for existence of the logical tape file at the file path
specified. The specified file path must match the exact case-sensitive path that was
used when the tape mount was requested. Submit the request again with the correct
file path. If the condition occurs during operator display of a pending request error
message, check to see if the help files are properly installed at the following:
/usr/openv/volmgr/help/robots/robot_type/help_file name (UNIX and Linux)
or at install_path\Volmgr\Help\Robots\robot_type\help_file_name
(Windows).

Device management status code 26

Message: Request terminated because the host was not validated for volume pool
Explanation: The host where the mount request was initiated is denied access to
the media. It is denied due to defined permissions for the volume pool in which the
media ID is contained.
Recommended Action:
■ Query the volume pool information for the requested volume pool on the host
where the mount request was issued by running vmpool -listall -b. Check
the system log to obtain the name of the host where the mount request originated.
This host name is the one returned by the system hostname(1) command.

■ Change the volume pool host name security with vmpool or another user interface

that supports volume pool host attributes. Or change the volume pool that is
associated with the volume (if it is not assigned). Or log on to the host that can
use media in the targeted volume pool. Then, submit the mount request again.

Device management status code 27

Message: Request terminated because media ID is expired
Explanation: A mount request was canceled because the media was requested
with write access, and the media has expired.
Recommended Action: Request read-only access to the media on the mount
request if a read-only operation is needed. Replace the media or change the
expiration date to a future date that is based on the site policy. Use the media

Device management status codes
Device management status codes

653

management interface to view and change the expiration date for the media. Check
and correct the system date and time, as needed.

Device management status code 28

Message: Error in MsgGet
Explanation: ltid made an attempt to obtain a message queue identifier that was
used for internal message communications. (ltid is the Media Manager device
daemon on UNIX and Linux or the NetBackup Device Manager service on Windows.)
The request failed due to a system error. The error probably indicates a lack of
system resources for message queues, or mismatched software components.
Recommended Action:
■ Examine command output, debug logs, and system logs for a more detailed

message on the error.
See "Setting Media Manager debug logging to a higher level" in the NetBackup
Logging Reference Guide.

■ On UNIX and Linux servers, gather the output of the ipcs -a command to see
what resources are currently in use. Check the installed software components
and verify that they are all at a compatible release version.

Device management status code 30

Message: Request terminated because media ID will exceed maximum mount
count
Explanation: A mount request has been canceled because the media being
requested has reached the maximum mount count that is associated with the media.
Recommended Action: Replace the media or change the maximum mount count
to a higher value that is based on the site policy. A media management interface
can be used to view and change the maximum mounts allowed for the media. Check
that the number of mounts for the media is set to a reasonable value given the
media’s usage history. Correct it as needed by using vmchange.

Device management status code 32

Message: Error in getting semaphore
Explanation: ltid made an attempt to obtain a semaphore that was used for
arbitrating access to shared memory. (ltid is the Media Manager device daemon
on UNIX and Linux or the NetBackup Device Manager service on Windows.) The

Device management status codes
Device management status codes

654

request failed due to a system error. The error probably indicates a lack of system
resources for semaphores, or mismatched software components.
Recommended Action:
■ Examine command output, debug logs, and system logs for a more detailed

message on the error.
See "Setting Media Manager debug logging to a higher level" in the NetBackup
Logging Reference Guide.

■ On UNIX and Linux servers, gather the output of the ipcs -a command to see

Device management status code 35

Message: Request terminated because media is unavailable (in DOWN drive,
misplaced, write protected or unmountable)
Explanation: A mount request was canceled because the media being requested
is not available. It may be in a DOWN drive or misplaced, write protected, or
unmountable. Another possible cause of this message is that you are using a
cleaning tape with no cleanings remaining.
Recommended Action: Use robotic inventory or manual means to compare the
contents of media in the robotic library with the volume configuration. Then, update
the configuration as needed. Determine the physical location of the media. Check
integrity of the drive, drive path, and media if the media is found in a logically DOWN
drive. Verify that the media is not a misconfigured cleaning tape. Move the media

Device management status codes
Device management status codes

655

into the robotic library and update the volume configuration if the media was not
present in the library. Set the cartridge tab to allow write access, or request the
media with read-only access if the write protection was the cause of the error.
If the problem is a cleaning tape with no cleanings remaining, replace the cleaning
tape.

Device management status code 36

Message: Request terminated by tpunmount call from another process
Explanation: A request was made to change the limit for the following: the number
of times that a volume can be mounted with write access for one or more volumes
in the volume configuration. The value specified was not within the acceptable
range. The maximum number of mounts value may also be invalid in the number
of mounts and cleanings field of a barcode rule.
Recommended Action:
■ Examine command output, debug logs, and system logs for a more detailed

message on the error.
See "Setting Media Manager debug logging to a higher level" in the NetBackup

Device management status code 37

Message: Drive being assigned is either not NDMP or on the wrong NDMP client
Explanation: A mount request was canceled because the request was targeted
to a drive configured as attached to an NDMP client. The request was manually
assigned to a drive other than the requested drive. The assigned drive is either not
NDMP or it is an NDMP drive configured to a different client.
Recommended Action: Display the device configuration to determine which drives
are configured as being attached to specific NDMP clients. Ensure that ltid was
stopped and restarted after the last configuration changes were made. Reissue the
request and assign it to a drive that is attached to the requested NDMP client.

Device management status code 38

Message: Character device name for drive is not a character device
Explanation: On a tape mount request, the configured tape drive’s
no-rewind-on-close device file was neither a character-special device nor of a known
type such as NDMP. (NDMP does not need to be a character special file.)

Recommended Action:
■ To avoid configuring invalid device paths and device names, use the Device

Configuration Wizard (on supported device discovery platforms). The wizard
automatically configures paths and device names for tape drives.

■ Always use no-rewind tape device files or recognized drive name syntax (such
as for NDMP) for tape drives. Make sure that the specified device paths exist
as character-special files. Check for detailed errors from the command or the
user interface output.
See the NetBackup Device Configuration Guide.

or check the Device Monitor in the NetBackup Administration Console.

■ Ensure that vmd (the NetBackup Volume Manager daemon on UNIX and Linux

or NetBackup Volume Manager service on Windows) is running on the scan
host. On the scan host, examine debug logs and system logs for any messages
that are related to the error.

■ Examine command output, debug logs, and system logs for a more detailed

message on the error.
See "Setting Media Manager debug logging to a higher level" in the NetBackup
Logging Reference Guide.

■ The detailed reason for the canceled request should be available in the daemon
debug logs on the scan host. Correct the problem and submit the request again
if needed.

Device management status code 48

Message: Host is not the scan host for this shared drive
Explanation: On a request to assign, reserve, or scan a drive, the targeted device
host determined that it was not the scan host for the drive. The request was refused
(the caller retries it).
Recommended Action:

■

If problems are encountered as a result of the reported error, check for
communication, configuration, and system problems among the associated
hosts. To check, use the vmoprcmd output or check the NetBackup
Administration Console Device Monitor.

Robotic status code 203

Message: Timeout waiting for robotic command
Explanation: A robotic operation timed out because it did not return with a status
before the designated time period elapsed.
Recommended Action:
■ Stop any robot test utilities, since they have the lock on the robotic device when

they are active, and can block other requests.

■ Check whether excessive hardware retries have delayed the completion of a

robotic command.

■ Check to see whether the robotic device still functions. Use a robot test utility
to send commands to the device to see whether it is responsive. Execute vmps
to verify that no unexpected Media Manager processes are running. Some
processes should remain running, but some processes that do not go away can
indicate a more serious problem, such as a hung system call.

Robotic status code 204

the unneeded processes that consume a lot of memory. Add more swap space or
physical memory, if necessary.

Robotic status codes
Robotic status codes

683

Robotic status code 242

Message: Robot media access port does not exist
Explanation: The requested media access port was not valid for use with the
targeted media.
Recommended Action: Use the robot test utility or a vendor administrative interface
to verify the media access port address based on the location of the media. Choose
a media access port that is valid, or let one be automatically selected, and retry the
robotic operation.

Robotic status code 243

Message: Cannot open/create the media access port status file
Explanation: A robotic daemon/process cannot create or open a status file in the
database directory/folder.
Recommended Action: Investigate why the robot status file in the directory
/usr/openv/volmgr/database (UNIX and Linux) or folder
install_path\Volmgr\database (Windows) cannot be created or opened. On
Windows, check which account the NetBackup Device Manager service (and
therefore, the robotic process) is running under. Compare it against the security
properties of the database folder.

Robotic status code 244

Message: The eject command was aborted by the user
Explanation: An administrator or operator canceled an eject media request.
Recommended Action: This error happens when an administrator or operator
cancels an eject request. The request may have been canceled for the following
reasons: missing or faulty media, to allow the media access port to be used for
other requests, or to perform the operation at a later time. Check with the
administrator or operator for more information.

Robotic status code 245

Message: Physical drive is not available
Explanation: A robotic mount operation could not be completed because the
physical drive resources are not available for the request. This error may result
from an environment that is based on virtualized resources, such as one involving
the Storagenet 6000 Storage Domain Manager (SN6000).

Robotic status codes
Robotic status codes

684

The SN6000 virtualizes tape drives. Some SN6000 configurations may have more
logical drives than the number of physical drives (or equivalent resources) available
for drive requests. Also, the relationship between the number of logical drives and
physical drives may change as hardware failures occur. NetBackup scheduling,
drive allocation, and drive assignment algorithms can only determine logical drive
availability. NetBackup attempts to fully use all configured and available logical
drives. If the number of required logical drives exceeds the physical drives available,
a NetBackup job may be started with insufficient drive resources. Instead of queueing
the job in the scheduler, the job runs and encounters the resource issue when it
makes an ACS tape mount request.
Recommended Action:

■

Install the Shared Storage Option (SSO) license for mount requests to requeue
when physical drive resources are not available.

■ The number of drives that can be in use at any one time is limited. Configure

backup windows so the different storage units that are tied to the same physical
drives are active only at non-overlapping times. Increase the media mount
timeout to avoid job failures when the job cannot get a physical drive due to the
drives all being busy.

Robotic status code 246

Message: Failed to find an available slot to inject to
Explanation: An attempt to inject a volume into a full library failed. This error should
only occur when the library is full. Full means that all storage elements either contain
media or have been assigned media that are currently mounted in a drive. Note
that some libraries that support multiple media types restrict which type of media
can be assigned to each storage element. In this case, this error might occur even
if some of the storage elements in a library were not full. Since the empty storage
elements may not match the media type for the media to inject, the library is full for
this media type.
Recommended Action: Clear the media access port, then re-inventory the robot
by doing a volume configuration update.

Robotic status code 249

Message: Volume is in home slot
Explanation: The volume is currently in its home slot and ready for eject.
